now to talk about the true state of our economy with facts and not the fantasy like the Biden regime keeps spewing to you Chief Economist and Global strategist and the founder of shift gold our good friend Peter Schiff back on the program so Peter they put out the CPI numbers they go oh it's all great I remember the job report last month they underestimated on purpose and said 122 we got 300 something thousand so they keep saying jobs are up inflation's going down everything's great that's not the true story is it Peter no I mean first of all the only reason that jobs are going up is because people are forced to take two or three jobs because prices keep going up and their paychecks are not and of course we've been replacing full-time jobs with part-time jobs so the numbers uh would favor uh extra jobs but today's inflation report was a disaster it really confirms what I've been warning for months now that inflation is bottoming that we're not at the peak but we're at the trough and we never got to 2% in fact if you look at the the core for the month of January which the FED prefers it was up 4/10 of 1% on the month if you annualize that that's 5% a year I mean that's really where we are and of course you probably have to double that to get to the actual rate because the government's rate so under understates what's going on exactly so the inflation problem is far from solved in fact it's here permanently and it's going to get a lot worse as the months go by Peter you're the numbers guy so I want you to dispel all these myths that the regime keeps pushing forward about these are the best numbers we've seen in 50 years okay but how bad was the economy when Joe took over because of all the covid lockdowns around the country again you can't say well the Trump regime handed us a horrible no no no states around this country like California run by Gavin Newsome Democrats did tyrannical lockdowns for over two and a half years they crushed small businesses medium even large businesses people lost their their jobs they lost their way everything and so of course if you're at the bottom and you start to come up in three years of an Administration it's going to look like major amazing growth but it's still not even close to back to normal pre9 2019 and Beyond behind that before covid hit so explain those numbers and how they're misconstruing them and tweaking them in their favor because I'm tired of hearing this crap 50 years Joe's got the best of no he doesn't well you know figures lie and and Liars figure and they're always going to try to spin these numbers and try to you know put lipstick on a pig but if you look at Biden's popularity which is uh the lowest of any president in history and you look at why he's so unpopular it's the economy yep when they pull the potential voters as to you know where they where Biden scores the lowest it's on the economy and so if the economy is as great as they're saying why isn't Biden getting any credit why are the people who are living in the economy so pessimistic about the economy uh that they they're blaming Biden for for for how bad things are so I think that is far more accurate than how the government is spinning it but even the government data you know they show us a one report you know these official jobs numbers but you have the household survey which comes out the same day and it's the mirror image of the the rosie report that they keep touting all the big companies are announcing layoffs I don't know any of them that are hiring uh so we're not getting good jobs meanwhile um if the economy was so great why are uh uh people drowning in debt why is credit card debt at an all-time record high despite record high credit card interest rates the only reason consumers are using their credit is because they're broke you know and if it was a good economy me they wouldn't have to depend on credit they would have the income to buy the things they need they wouldn't have to be borrowing money and going this deeply into debt yeah Peter we just put up a a graphic that showed an article I think from the website of zeroedge who shows how much debt we Americans are in and you have been hammering this for a year on this program 1.56 trillion for just credit card and overall household debt overall top 7 15.5 trillion that's the highest number in American history for Citizens debt that is astronomical yeah and that's just what they owe on their own remember all the citizens are on the hook for their share of the national debt oh right because the government is borrowing in our names and that's 34.2 trillion so if you break it down per household that's an even bigger number than the household debt that people have taken on by themselves and again if the economy was strong we wouldn't be running up a trillion dollars of red ink a quarter on the national debt because the strong economy lowers deficits because you get uh more production you get higher tax revenues the government doesn't have to spend as much on you know support programs but what we're seeing is a uh fiscal situation that looks like we're in recession yeah and the Dow probably wouldn't drop almost 700 points I know it ended only about 450 or 500 down today but the Dow Jones obviously investors didn't like this latest CPI and and all the job report numbers that just came out in the last week or so because why would it tank we had huge gains since January and it took a hit today right yeah and investors still don't understand how bad it is investors think that what this report means is that the FED just has to fight a little harder to win the inflation War so maybe the rate Cuts get delayed a few months that's not what it means it means that the FED has already lost the inflation fight because the FED can't hike rates more which is what it needs to do I mean the fact that we have record debt uh government and individual debt that proves that the interest rates were too little too late because the way Rising interest rates are supposed to reduce inflation is by reducing borrowing and spending but none of that is happening no everybody is borrowing and spend more despite the rate the rate hikes and so it's not enough and actually the rate hikes are prices interest rates are prices and they work through the economy just like rents or raw materials or wages and so these Rising prices higher interest rates are actually going to cause the CPI to go up final question and probably doesn't help as you just talked about our national debt 33 34 trillion on top of the household debt 77 and a half trillion it doesn't help when your Senate passes another $95 billion foreign aid bill so then investors and the American people see our government spending more money we don't have few seconds left you get the final say on that one yeah well you know we're borrowing money from the rest of the world to recycle it back to other parts of the world look we can't give Aid to other nations when we're already broke yes sure if we had big surpluses and we wanted to share some of the wealth but we can't go deeper into debt at a minimum if they want to appropriate some funds they need to cut someplace else they can't just act like we could spend whatever we want because all this is going to do is add to the inflationary pressures that are already building in the economy Peter we always like that you keep it real and bring the facts and numbers unlike this alleged Administration that we have to listen to lie to us every single day Peter Schiff Chief Economist Global strategist founder shift gold as always thank you sir appreciate you thank you

there was a lot of action in the gold market this week after spending a record 41 consecutive trading days not calendar days but trading days above 2,000 without trading below it at all gold finally plunged below 2,000 on Tuesday it dropped about $30 an ounce and it was trading at about 1990 a little bit lower and it stayed at that level on Wednesday as well but on Thursday it got back above 2,000 and added to those gains today so it closed the week about $2,013 an ounce it was actually up about a dollar or two on the week and I think that this move below 2,000 could be the final ShakeOut for gold before it moves up to new highs now the catalyst for that move on Tuesday was ironically the release of a hotter than expected January CPI number meaning that the inflation numbers came out higher than the markets had expected in fact they probably expected good news they probably thought that we'd get lower numbers than was expected and instead it was the reverse now I say it's ironic because gold is an inflation hedge the point of buying gold is to protect you from inflation it preserves purchasing power it's a store of value so it should be good news that inflation is worse than people expected because that means there's more reasons to buy gold but the way it's worked for the past year or so is the reverse it's been higher than expected inflation news that's caused gold to sell off it's when inflation comes out lower than expected that people want to buy gold again why would that happen because it makes no sense fundamentally that that would be the case well the reason is because every time the inflation numbers are higher than expected the market expects the FED to have to fight a little bit harder to win the inflation war and it's that harder fight that gets traders to sell gold in fact I don't even think any body decides to sell I think it's already programmed into the trading algorithms anytime inflation news comes out lower than expected these algorithms are pre-programmed to sell gold to buy the dollar because they think it means a tighter fed that it's going to be higher for longer that we're going to have to wait a little bit longer for the First Rate cut and and therefore that means Gold's going to have a problem but the markets still haven't figured out and I think think they will soon that hotter than expected inflation doesn't mean the FED just has to fight a little harder to win the inflation fight it actually confirms that it's already lost the idea that inflation is going to go down to 2% is farsal there's no way that's going to happen and I've been pointing that out yes we went down from 9% to 3% but that doesn't mean we're going to just Glide down to 2% if you look at all the fundamentals everything points to higher inflation a resurgent CPI if you look at all of the uh factors that should have been influenced by higher interest rates because the way higher rates are supposed to reduce inflation is by reducing demand they reduce spending they make it more expensive to borrow and so you borrow less you spend less but none of that has happened government spending is off the charts budget deficits are soaring the US government hasn't tightened its belt because interest rates have gone up it just keeps borrowing more and the same thing with consumers Consumer Debt is at an all-time record high credit card debt is at an all-time record high even though credit card interest rates are at an all-time record high that hasn't stopped the spending and so nothing that the FED has done is going to reduce inflation the fact that the official rate has come down from 9% to 3% is not really a function of anything the FED has done it's simply uh the way the market has traded nothing goes in a straight line but what really was responsible for the move down was the anticipation of all the rate hikes that strengthened the dollar that brought down commodity prices oil prices brought down the headline CPI but all that is in the past nobody expects any additional rate hikes and nor do I so the rate hikes are in our past not in our future and that means the dollar is going down and that means the uh headwind that pushed prices down is now a Tailwind that's going to push them back up in fact look at oil prices uh on the week closing above $78 positive on the week even though stocks and bonds were down uh bond pric is also getting clobbered on the week so Rising long-term interest rates Rising oil prices are a sign of resurgent inflation but so was the CPI number that came out today in fact I've been pointing out on my podcasts over the last several months that contrary to the conventional wisdom inflation isn't heading lower it's bottoming it's forming a base and it's about to head back up which is exactly what we're seeing the markets just think that this is an aberration in fact fed officials came out on Wednesday and did damage control they said that the hotter than expected CPI number uh doesn't change anything it's within their expectations and everything is still on track for uh rate hikes rate Cuts rather in 2024 now if the FED really was being honest they would be hiking rates they wouldn't even be talking about when they're going to cut rates rates are still too low it's obvious because they've had no effect on slowing down borrowing or spending meanwhile you know if you look at all the economic data the manufacturing data that continues to be weak and so we're producing less and we're spending more that's a recipe for much higher prices and nothing the FED has done uh has has changed that but the markets still believe the FED they still think the FED is committed to Bringing inflation down to 2% it's not it's already surrendered it's all a pretense that it's going to go back down because the reason the fed pivoted and stopped hiking rates was because they didn't want the economy to buckle beneath the weight of rising interest rates it was already starting to happen bond yields were above 5% for the 10 year out to the 30-year and the markets couldn't handle it the housing market in fact we got housing data that came out today that was the weakest uh uh I think since or the weakest January uh since covid lockdowns and so the housing market is already having a lot of trouble with rates the way they are the FED can't afford to raise them especially in an election year so the rate hikes are off the table but the other thing that the markets have got wrong is their outlook for the economy they think inflation is going to uh come down but the economy is still great we've avoided recession they're wrong on that too the economy is weakening just as inflation is strengthening in fact look at the numbers we got today on retail sales they plunged uh far more than expected down8 they were looking for a drop of just 0.1 but if you look at X vehicles uh retail sales plunged six they were supposed to rise by 0.2 and X vehicles and gasoline a drop of 0.5 versus expectations of a rise of 02 and they even revised down the prior month and remember retail sales are not adjusted for inflation so even though prices are going up sales are falling that means volume is really coming down and you know we got more inflation news today more bad news on inflation what was interesting is that after an initial sell-off gold dropped about $10 when we got the hotter than expected PPI that came out this morning gold bounced back um and the dollar which initially rallied again the dollar does the same thing when there's hotter than expected inflation people buy the dollar why would you do that fundamentally what inflation means is that the dollar is losing purchasing power and so if the dollar is losing purchasing power faster than you thought why would that incentivize you to want to buy the dollar it's a reason to want to get rid of your dollars but again it's the anticipation of higher interest rates that is driving this trade but the reality is rates aren't going up anymore in fact they're going to come down even if the FED delays the official rate Cuts real interest rates are falling because if rates stay where they are but inflation goes up which is what it's doing that means real interest rates are falling and real interest rates are far more important for the price of gold than nominal but looking at the PPI numbers and this was even worse than the CPI and the PPI is a leading indicator of the CPI because generally producer prices rise first and then consumer prices rise later and so this is more indicative of higher future CPI numbers than the CPI itself and the uh monthly number was supposed to be up by 0.1 instead it was up by .3 the core uh number was supposed to be up 0.1 and instead it Rose by 05 that is a big number in fact the beat in core month-over-month CPI this is the biggest beat meaning the most the core Rose above what it was expected expected to rise this is the biggest beat in three years now that doesn't sound like a Fed that has succeeded in putting the inflation Genie back in the bottle when the numbers are coming out so much hotter than expected in fact getting back to the uh Consumer Price number that we got on Tuesday if you annualize the increase in the core in uh the month of January it annualized out to 5% I mean that's more than double the 2% that the FED is in theory targeting actually this week we had a trifecta of worse than expected inflation news we got import export prices that came out yesterday now not too many people even follow import export prices they talk about the PPI they talk about the PPI but these numbers are highly manipulated by the government I like the import export prices better because they're not adjusted they are what they are there's no hedonics there's no substitution and the expectations for January uh import prices uh was a drop of 0.1% and the expectation for export prices was a drop of0 2% but what happened was both both Import and Export prices spiked by 8% that is a huge move in one month and to me it's another indicator that inflation is bottomed in fact import export prices are more of a forward looking number especially the import prices uh because those are ultimately going to be uh put into final goods because the importers are generally uh the businesses and they turn around and resell and so these higher import prices are going to be reflected in higher retail sales prices in the months ahead so this is more news uh that the markets are ignoring that inflation is not bottom and in fact the idea that we're going to continue to drift lower down to 2% is absurd inflation is far more likely to rise back to 9% than it is to go back down to 2% so the markets still don't get this the FED for whatever reason still maintains its credit ability but I think the fact that the price of gold recovered quickly and managed not only to close positive on the day but positive on the week and back above 2000 even though we had all these uh higher than expected inflation numbers that have pushed back the expectation of when the FED is going to start cutting rates I think that's a very strong sign in the gold market of course there was weakness against in gold mining stocks they finished down on the week they really got clobbered on on Tuesday when gold went down because there's so much fear in uh the Gold stock market and I think that is a very strong contrarian indicator uh that we're at the bottom when so many people are fearful in fact Barrett gold this week which is one of the you know bellweather uh stocks made a 52e low on the week even though gold barely went below 2,000 you're talking about major Mining Company where sentiment is so negative that it traded at a 52- we low and I think another contrarian indicator on the week had to do with the rally in all these new Bitcoin ETFs which rallied big and made new highs and I saw a lot of people posting charts that showed huge outflows of the gold ETF GLD and big inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs and they're trying to say that see everybody is moving out of gold ETFs into Bitcoin ETFs now I doubt much of the money that went out of the gold ETFs actually went into these Bitcoin ETFs I think a lot of these gold investors are throwing in the towel it doesn't mean they're necessarily buying Bitcoin just because they're selling their gold but I think uh the Bitcoin Pumpers are trying to uh pretend that this is what's going on although it certainly uh is possible that some of the money that went out of of gold ETFs went into uh Bitcoin ETFs my guess is most of it just went into money market uh or maybe into the stock market but not into these ETFs but I think the fact that you got this big rally and I think the Catalyst for the rise in the Bitcoin ETFs first of all they all dumped about 20% immediately after they were first launched but there was a big ETF conference down in Miami this week and Bitcoin is notorious for Pump and dumps around these type of uh events so I'm sure there was a lot of hype a lot of pump and Circumstance uh about the Bitcoin ETFs I mean they were probably the talk of the conference and so that probably caused a lot of people to buy and pump up the price so my guess would be next week we'll see the dump uh following this week's pump but I think where the action is going to be is in Gold while everybody was sidetracked by what was going on in Bitcoin they overlooked what's going on in Gold uh everybody is writing Gold's obituary it's not dead it's alive and well it's over 2,000 but the most important thing is the fundamentals have never been better not only do the charts look great for gold but the fundamentals are fantastic because we're in a situation where we have inflation that has just bottomed at about 3% is now headed High higher and there's nothing the FED could do about it it is out of ammo it can't fight there is no way the FED is going to hike rates it would crash the economy and it would sink any chance Biden has of getting reelected if he even has much of a chance to begin with and the economy is weakening makes making it even harder for the FED to hike rates because how can it ignore a weakening economy uh and Hike rates anyway so it's going to dismiss any increase in inflation in fact it's already done that this week it's almost like it's back on its transitory kick only nobody is going to use the word transitory but they're basically looking at any hotter than expected inflation data as if it's a one-off thing as if it's a foregone conclusion that inflation is going back down to 2% when there's no reason to expect that that's going to happen not with record high budget deficits a record high consumer borrowing and spending weakening in industrial production money supply is now growing and real interest rates are falling and so all signs point to higher inflation and a weaker economy and that's the perfect environment for gold it is stagflation and as investors lose confidence in the FED they're going to look for a real safe haven a real store of value and they're going to buy gold in the mean time I would suggest uh those of you who are listening to this uh video uh don't don't wait for uh the average investor even Wall Street uh to figure this out just go and buy I think you're right near the bottom I mean even if you get slightly below 2,000 there is massive support beneath this market so I think the downside risk is really minimal I think the upside potential is enormous I know it's a holiday weekend uh George Washington's birthday I don't like to call it President's Day because I like George Washington not all the presidents that followed especially uh the president that we have now I don't want to have a holiday uh that celebrates Joe Biden uh but uh it's a long weekend the markets are closed on Monday but the gold markets don't close and neither does shift gold and so I talked with the guys that shift gold uh I think next week could be a big week this was significant shake out so anybody who wants to buy some more gold or silver uh you can contact uh shift gold the representatives will be there I don't know if it'll be 247 but they'll call you back if there's nobody there leave a message send them a note we can get your orders in you don't have to wait for Tuesday uh to buy more gold and silver and who knows you know one of these weekends we're going to have a big drop in the dollar we're going to have a big run up in the price of gold and it's better to buy yours before that happens anyway thanks everybody for listening and have a great uh holiday weekend bye for now

folks we've got about 54 minutes left to trade before we close out what has been such a volatile first week of the second quarter even with the point gains that we're seeing for this session you can see the Dow is still on Pace for its worst week in more than a year it will have lost about 2 and a qu% for the week S&P down 1% the Dow and the S&P by the way are on track to snap two week winning streaks and it looks like the NASDAQ will lose about 1% just under 1% for the week the gains we are seeing today though come on the heels of the March jobs report US employers hired 303,000 workers in March way more than the 200,000 expected unemployment ticked down to 3.8% from 3.9% annual increases in wages did soften from the previous month but still came in up 4.1% this stronger labor market complicates the Federal Reserve stated plan to cut interest rates sometime this year which has triggered a stellar R rally in Precious medals over the past five sessions look at the move in gold gold has gained about let's see four four full percentage points over the week 60 bucks per troy ounce and as you see we've got another fresh record high for the yellow metal Silver is no slouch at all in fact it's looking at a 10% gain week to date both a precious and Industrial Metal that's what silver is it is melting up this week nice move there let's bring in the floor show traders to tackle all of it it Economist and perennial gold buug Peter Schiff joins us along with options King John nerian of Marcus's Rebellion John at this time yesterday stocks plummeted on news of that tense phone call where President Biden basically threatened Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that unless Israel agrees to a ceas in Gaza the US might pull out aid but or at least diminish it that stock sell off we saw yesterday appears to be over at least for now did investors who were hoping for an entry point just simply miss it because it was so fast um I guess the simple answer is yes Liz but uh I didn't view yesterday's you know very small pullback in terms of a percentage move I didn't view that as an entry level really not for the way that I trade I think you'd really have to be uh a high frequency Trader practically to get into that uh I do think we'll get more opportunities Liz both from the tensions in the Middle East perhaps putting some pressure on stocks we've seen the vol volatility index up 30% just in the last five trading sessions and we've seen the crude oil index the ox the volatility of crude oil moving up substantially so I'd say that could create a better entry in the coming weeks as well as more fed speak like Mr cashcari yesterday that you just detailed we're putting up on the screen what you would buy if you were an investor who wanted exposure to the markets John what is that trade you're saying there are call and put options that you could mix and match well you could of course that's always true and uh you know you're an astute Market Watcher and Trader Liz um I would say that I would be buying at the money S&P 500 calls out in August I'd want to give myself time they're going to Decay much slower and then I would start selling May options call options against those that I purchased the reason for that is faster time Decay and also that I think we're going to get a move or a nonm move perhaps at that meeting 26 days from now when we actually get the fomc meeting again Liz okay yeah Peter no flash dip at all no opportunity to jump into gold over the past at least month or so because it just keeps hitting record after record can you explain to our viewers Why We are continuing to see Gold Spike so high yeah well first of all is you know the the labor market isn't strong it's weak all the jobs that are being created are part-time jobs for Americans who are forced to Moonlight because inflation is driving up the cost of living and inflation is going to keep going up that's why gold is rising uh it's it's a signal that the monetary policy is wrong uh that Pal's rate cut could go down as the biggest mistake the FED has ever made and they've made a lot of mistakes so that's saying a lot in fact they should be raising interest rates but the gold Traders know that pal is too too afraid to raise interest rates cuz he caus caused a financial crisis but if you look at the landscape oil is already up 22% this year it was down 10% last year and the CPI was up 4.1 imagine how high it's going to rise this year with that move in oil look at the crb oh the commodity prices which were flat last year are already up 177% this year it's only the first quarter so inflation is coming roaring back and the FED is pretending that it's gone away yeah you know you look at oil as well oil has had an incredible move uh gold of course hitting a record right now $2,342 a Troy ounce but let's bring back John to the conversation you know when you talk about oil you add other Commodities into the mix whether it's ARB gasoline wholesale just about everything else except maybe corn and wheat and and natural gas those are down year to date uh what is the trade there because you can look at the volatility that we've seen lately and and well I'll let you tell our viewers John well uh um we've seen a lot of speculation Liz and even some m& or mergers and Acquisitions going on in the energy space and that's not surprising um because we've seen a a six-month High I believe out of crude oil as it trades up through 86 and Brent is through 90 right now uh Middle East tensions as well as what's going on with drones back and forth Russia to Ukraine and vice versa that's all going to put more demand or at least Less in the supply Liz and either of those either uh taking some of the supply away or increasing demand into the Fourth of July holiday which we see every single year that's going to push oil up I think WTI has $90 a barrel written all over it so rig Trans Ocean is one of the plays in that space I would keep my eye on those oil stocks L and you can always buy oil volatility the ovx which is right up on our screen right now uh while it's slightly down right now it has had an a pretty significant runup over the past uh more than six months I believe or at least year to date all right uh Peter you've got to explain about the options to buy the opportunities to buy oil names or let's say for example gold and silver names Silver's really roared higher what are your picks here well you know I think that these stocks are going to explode almost any day you know you this week the GDX which is an index of senior gold mining stocks is up 7% a gdxj which is Junior mining stocks is up 9% but these stocks are still dirt cheap they're they're barely positive on the year because the whole time goal was Rising everybody expected it to fall you know a couple of months ago or one month ago analysts were downgrading Newmont Mining and Barrack gold to cells you know basically holds and sells these stocks are now up 30% since those downgrades Wall Street has got this trade completely wrong uh you should just buy these stocks you know I managing gol fund the europacific GOL fund Adrian day manages for me people can buy that no load if you want to buy individual stocks you I gave you a couple of names panamerican silver for silver ago Eagle uh in the gold space but just buy them you don't have to wait for a dip they're they're cheap even though they've gone up so much you just got to get into these names it's a bull market uh and especially if you were foolish enough to buy any of these Bitcoin ETFs you should sell these ETFs right now before the market closes take that money put it into some gold stocks right because Bitcoin is fool's gold you want to own the real thing and if you really want to make 10 times your money 20 50 times your money I think you can do it uh in these Junior mining stocks Junior mining stocks two names he gives us AEM and P A for those of you well those

to ask our next guest what he thinks about the state of our economy and all these headlines I just brought up Chief Economist Global strategist founder shift gold our buddy Peter Schiff back on the program Peter how about it 50 bucks an hour federal wage what do you think you're a global strategist and a chief Economist would I be paying about 2750 or 30 bucks for that Big Mac meal well you know first of all at the rate they're creating inflation I think that a lady's going to get her wish because I think pretty soon the minimum wage is going to have to be $50 an hour for it to be equal to 725 uh because prices are going up you know when I when I read that report about the exemption for uh bakeries in California my first thought was well why doesn't McDonald's just start baking their buns right that's I I think I think the law says that in order to qualify for the exemption you had to have been baking bread last year so they already figured that companies would try to get around it by starting to bake so it it purely is there to Pro protect p uh Panera Bread which shows you uh you know this whole thing is political and uh Newsome obviously knows that this is not good uh for workers otherwise it would apply to Panera Bread as well uh so it's all political it's trying to get votes it's the labor unions that are behind this uh because it prices a lot of people out of jobs it's terrible Economic Policy but of course on a national level you're talking about the debt the budget deficit now is gone or national debt is above 34.4 trillion we've added 400 billion in the last 2 months that's 200 billion a month I remember when 200 billion was a big deficit to run for an entire year now we're racking them up every month that's a $200 billion inflation tax that everybody has to pay we're not getting government for free there's no free lunch uh and uh we're paying for it with higher prices no kidding we are um the spending bill this the the continued resolution to just just kicked the can down the road with that news I got to imagine the markets didn't fare well and now we're looking at them in what late March having to vote again by all Accords they're going to continue this budget and until you see what massive cuts to the tunes of I would think billions right none of this will begin to come down because everybody's going to project that inflation will stay high as long as this Congress and these people in DC continue just to print and spend money we don't have well the market still don't realize that inflation is not only going to stay high it's going to go higher they still expect inflation to come down just because the FED raised rates to 5% that's not going to do it because the whole time the Fed was supposedly fighting inflation the government was creating it it's we have an inflationary fiscal policy that offset whatever pal did plus he didn't raise rates enough because he didn't slow down credit growth uh credit is at all-time record high not only are the is the government borrowing record amounts of money but households are in debt they have record credit card debt and they're spending money but they're spending it on food they're spending it on rent they're spending it on insurance that's why durable goods are coming down because after you spend all this money on the Necessities you've got nothing left over for anything else so the spending continues and the inflation is going to continue and when the market starts pricing that in look out and durable goods you know people aren't buying I saw an example like you know a new refrigerator if it's on the fritz they can't afford it they're going to go get a used one off Craigs List Right or a washer dryer from the garage sale because it's so expensive to fill up the refrigerator you know there was a CEO of Kelloggs was was on television he was happy that they're selling more cereal because he said people are having cereal for dinner cuz that's all they could afford and a lot of them are skipping breakfast cuz they can't even afford that so they have lunch and then for dinner they have breakfast wow Peter um one of these days when you come on this program we are going to have good news about this economy the only thing I will say in close is it will probably take until next year with a regime change and then immediate policy change when it comes to energy and then I think and I hope and I pray that I will see you on this set even though we'll have much more to talk about over the next nine months but in February time frame I'm guessing you're going to have some good news for us until then everybody just buckle up Peter thank you man have a good weekend care yep have a good weekend

now consumers aren't feeling too confident about the economy in fact uh they haven't felt this bad about it since November so us consumer sentiment dropped to a 6mon low in May and this is amid growing anxiety about inflation Rising unemployment rates and high interest rates as well so the University of Michigan released its latest consumer sentiment index today and this month's reading came in much lower compared to the last month and it is the lowest since November as I mentioned earlier consumers expressing worries that inflation unemployment and interest rates may all be moving in the wrong direction here and bracing for even higher price increases in the year ahead um so this consumer sentiment index is actually closely tracked by the Biden Administration so keep that in mind and earlier I talked to Chief Economist Peter Schiff at europacific asset management for why he thinks consumer sentiment is so and for his outlook on the US economy take a listen Peter great to talk to you again consumer sentiment out today lowest in 6 months it looks like and and Peter let me just point out it's not just that uh the most recent jobs report sharp drop in jobs added unemployment up uh the most most recent GDP estimate coming in low and yesterday just yesterday jobless claims highest in 8 months Peter What's Happening Here well you know if consumers only knew just how much worse it's going to get confidence would be even lower they're actually a little bit too optimistic about about the future what they're really concerned about is rising inflation and high interest rates and the problem is interest rates aren't really high yet and unless the FED raises rates even more inflation is going much higher so the FED is in a box if it tries to raise consumer confidence because if it tries to fight inflation which is worrying the consumer it's got to raise interest rates but that's already worrying the consumer and so higher rates to fight inflation may cause confidence to fall even further on the other hand If the Fed doesn't raise rates or Cuts them as planned inflation is going to get a whole lot worse which means consumer confidence can only go down the FED is planning on reducing rates despite the fact that rates are still too low but the problem is Americans have so much debt that even these low rates are too high that's the main reason the FED stopped hiking because we started to see another financial crisis as the banks started to fail and the US government is in a a bind fiscally you know every time the FED raises rates it it causes budget deficits to widen because now the government has to spend more interest to cover its debts plus it also weakens the economy so tax receipts go down so as the budget deficits are swelling that puts more upward pressure on inflation and so as the FED tries to fight inflation by hiking rates it just ends up making it worse so are are you seeing inflation flaring up again because we did see CPI go up for the past 3 months yeah well inflation's headed back up I mean it it only went down temporarily that decline from 9% to 3% uh was transitory now we're headed back up we be above 9% before we get down to 2% I I have no idea when we're going to get to 2% it may not be for decades how's the consumer doing because if we're looking at the most recent earnings reports uh I'm talking about McDonald's and Starbucks here uh it seems like the consumer uh may not be on such solid footing no he's he's on life support right now the consumer is in a lot of trouble he's got a record amount of debt credit card debt household debt savings are totally depleted the cost of living has skyrocketed and is going much higher and a lot of Americans are now holding down multiple jobs just to make ends meet people are working evenings they're working over the weekends uh that's why we have all this job creation because people are Moonlighting you need two or three jobs now to pay for what one job uh used to provide for just a few years ago just a few months ago you know a lot of economists analysts they're predicting a recession in the econ economy now nobody sees a recession um what what's your base case for the economy well they're they're blind we're probably already in a recession I mean a lot of the numbers that we're getting that indicate otherwise are probably going to be rised lower probably after the election but not only are we going to be in a recession or we're already in one but inflation is going to get worse so it's stagflation and pal just said at the last press conference he doesn't see any signs of stagnation or inflation and he's wrong on both counts I mean the signs are obvious to everybody maybe except the people on the fomc who couldn't see the 2008 financial crisis coming who believed that the 2021 inflation was transitory they're wrong again this is stagflation except stagnation is going to be more like depression and the inflation part could be closer to hyperinflation that's how bad it's going to be what does the US need to do to turn the ship around well I mean at this point I don't know that you could turn it around it's a little late for that but there are things that we could do to mitigate the damage when you know we collide with the iceberg or whatever's we're going to hit but what we need is dramatic cuts to government spending we need much lower budget deficits in fact it'd be nice to have some surpluses to start paying down the debt but the government is doing the opposite of what it needs to do it's increasing spending and so it's uh making the problem worse uh so I don't see any political will will in Washington to take the steps that are necessary to soften the the the impact uh so we're going to you know hit hit uh you know full steam ahead and so you know people have got to just brace themselves for that impact and do what they can to protect their wealth because uh you know the government's not going to do anything and neither is the Fed all right thank you very much today Peter Shi always great to have your Insight EUR Pacific Asset Management my pleasure here

you've been waiting for it right well it's here the having it's Upon Us in the Bitcoin Community let's just say they're champing at the bit and why not take a look at that I think this would be the fourth run right the prior three all saw strong rallies over the next 12 to 18 months let's bring in coin Stories podcast host Natalie brell all right Natalie so is there a chance though that when this initially happens we could actually get the old buy the rumor sell the news kind of thing sure I mean a lot of this has been priced in so I think we can expect short-term volatility as usual but long-term the price has been trending up and we've actually never seen a new all-time high in a cycle prior to the next having so things can get a little spicy here we've got them on the chart here I mean so it's just amazing the first one I mean just it's just absolutely it's hard not to be enticed by what we're seeing here again over a certain period of time yeah the logarithmic chart is always really expressive of the fact that Bitcoin is just going up in One Direction but you know a lot of people can get kind of confused what is the having CU we've never had an asset that has this baked in reduction in the incoming Supply regardless of the demand but I really think it demonstrates the Elegance of this programmatic monetary policy that really is an elegant set of rules with no rulers that we all engage in and participate in voluntarily no one's imposing this on us Bitcoin is chosen by us the people and this is the core one of the core value propositions of it right uh but I want to ask you about the last few days uh bitcoin's come down a lot and so folks who are anti- Bitcoin are saying Hey there you go it was sold to us as a as a sort of a hedge against geopolitics and as soon as something flares up it collapsed what do you say to people like that well you know it's the fast money that's selling in and out of Bitcoin and creating this short-term volatility the smart money and the permanent capital is seeking shelter in Bitcoin and more and more investors are going to see it as this flight to safety including when things get more and more uncertain and chaotic around us because Bitcoin is the one thing that is actually certain and predictable the having is just another example of that it decouples the power to manipulate money from the state and it allows all of us to be in a Fair competition so that real value can come to the surface all right Natalie I want you to hold right there for a second because I'm going to get back to you in a second but I also want to bring in a friend of ours it seems these days everyone is gold member right check this out Goldman Sachs saying gold $2,700 an ounce this year now we know of course Emerging Market central banks have been buying gold for a long time look at that go all the way back a decade or so folks these are central banks not the ECB or the or the Fed let's bring in Euro Pacific Capital Chief Economist also Global strategist Peter Schiff all right Peter gold obviously rocking everyone's obviously jumping on a bandwagon the question is why now why at this particular time well you know Gold's probably going to close at a new record high close today it's only a few dollars off it now above 2370 you know gold is rising because the dollar the Euro at the Yen Fiat currencies are losing value inflation is real it's here to stay it's not going anywhere near the fed's 2% Target we're headed in the wrong direction we'll probably be in double digits by next year and eventually the first digit isn't going to be a one uh central banks are out in front of this they're the main buyers you know a lot of Americans have been foolishly selling their gold to buy these Bitcoin ETFs you know there's nothing elegant about losing your money in Bitcoin Bitcoin is not going up in fact Bitcoin Peak two and a half years ago at about 37 o of gold as we speak now it's worth less than 27 o that's a 27% decline in 2 and 1/2 years this is a bare Market Bitcoin is going much lower than this if Natalie were smart as soon as this segment is over she would sell all of her Bitcoin because if she doesn't sell it now she's going to sell it later at a much lower price all right well them's what we call fighting words uh and I think they're similar drivers for both but let me introduce the two uh Natalie Natalie Peter Peter meet Natalie all right Natalie some Choice words for you what would you tell Peter oh I know Peter and you know what bitcoiners don't feel the need to constantly attack gold because we're not threatened by gold and the reason that we have this failed Fiat experiment that is impoverished our nation is because of the defects of gold the fact that it's not easily portable it's not easily verifiable it doesn't offer instant final global settlement and so you know what centralized authorities hijacked it they papered over it and we have a system of of Leverage and rehypothecation that hurts the working class Bitcoin is immune to all of that it is the savings account for billions of people that we really need and and can most rely on and it offers that final global settlement that we need and so gold is the analog version of sound money but Bitcoin is the digital version and that's why it's going to be the faster horse in this race Peter there's there there's nothing sound about Bitcoin it's losing the race right now take a look at your screen gold is up $25 $26 and Bitcoin is getting clobbered you know there is no flaw in gold gold worked great for 5,000 years the problem is the flaws with governments the flaws with human beings not with gold uh but Bitcoin is is really flawed because it doesn't have any actual value gold is the most useful metal on the periodic table that's why it's money now it has great characteristics that make it better money than other Commodities but absent its intrinsic value it it couldn't be money and Bitcoin has no intrinsic value it's just a digital numbers and all of this is just a bunch of hype anything could be money right on the island of Yap they used to have big Stone uh Stone money anything could be money uh if people use it as an exchange and this is the thing but that's because but here's the thing though you have to admit Bitcoin is on the rise Wall Street has embraced it uh and this is just a tiny spec I mean could you imagine could you imagine Peter at the rate of of recognition if Bitcoin keeps going as at this rate it's hard to deny it could go substantially higher no I just told you it's been dropping for two and a half years that's when it that when it made Rec and I think that decline is going to accelerate it it it does not keep going up they suckered in a bunch of people Wall Street didn't embrace it they're just trying to make a buck off it I mean these big Wall Street firms aren't buying any Bitcoin with their own money this is their customers money that are dumb enough to buy it they're just booking the bets they're operating the casino they're not at the blackjack tables or the roulette wheels that's their customers that are doing that Natalie wants to jump back in you know if you look at the shortterm Bitcoin is going to be volatile but if we zoom out Bitcoin has outperformed gold in fact when Hamas attacked Israel since then Bitcoin is up 125% and gold is up only 27% so let's really look at the numbers that we're seeing and the best thing about Bitcoin is again no one controls The Ledger whereas gold is really vulnerable to centralization and top down control which is why we need a system that is a neutral place to store your wealth we need a neutral system andet why can't someone own both why can't someone have exposure to both yeah well first of all Bitcoin is outperformed everything so don't compare it to Gold it's outperformed stocks real estate bonds Collectibles that's because it's a gigantic bubble no if you want to own Bitcoin I I don't care if you want to lose money in Bitcoin go right ahead doesn't bother me but I'm trying to help give people advice as to what to do with their money and if they want to have an Investment Portfolio Bitcoin has no part in it but you know if you like gambling if you want to take some of the money that you we're going to take to the racetracks or buy lottery tickets with or go to Vegas if you want to take some of that money and gamble on bitcoin or any of the other 20,000 cryptocurrencies that are out there go right ahead I it doesn't bother me but I don't want to buy any Bitcoin I mean sure had I bought Bitcoin years and years a go when I first learned about it yeah I could have made a lot of money selling it now to the greater fools but I didn't do that bought Bitcoin yeah so so Natalie bottom line though is but I'm not going to buy it now and Natalie you're going to wish you sold Bitcoin mark my words you're Ru we we tap all of this if I only sold my Bitcoin i' had a lot of money we got 30 seconds left I got to give Natalie the last word I think a I think the American dream has really been hijacked we we tried gold it didn't work it was papered over that system has failed the American people and Bitcoin does provide hope for us the working class we want to be able to work for something that has to be measured by a free market so that we can see real value emerge as opposed to being captured by politics and bureaucracy which ultimately is a system that benefits the few at the at the expense of everyone else and it's a system in which the politically connected and the special interest groups really are at the top and so we need a system that is for the people Bitcoin is for the people Natalie thank you very much Peter thank you very much

joining us now with more insight into our current economic state chief Economist Global strategist and founder of shift gold Peter Schiff back on the program Peter nice to see you um let's get right after it every time you come on I'm looking for a silver lining I'm looking for some good news and I don't know if I can find it today you got anything good or we're just going to go with what the hell's going on in reality oh the news is unfortunately bad I'm just the messenger I know shoot me but you know you talked about oil just before uh you know I came on and you know they can't afford to refill the Strategic petroleum Reserve because the price of oil has already gone up 22% this year it's at $87 a barrel you know last year oil prices were down 10% for the year and the CPI was up 4.1 this year we're only a quarter of the way finished with the year and we're already up 22% and you have pal and everybody else saying that inflation is going to come down this year how is that possible with not oil prices the crb is exploding and in fact gold prices just took out 2300 alltime record high this is all because inflation is coming back big and that's what's going to make home ownership and just about everything else completely unaffordable because prices are going to go up a lot faster I think this year than they did in the last couple years and it was bad in the last couple years yeah no kidding it's been horrific and I'm tired of hearing these lying pieces of from the Biden regime and the mainstream media being like a little parrot with the talking points that things aren't that bad well people just aren't maybe seeing or feeling how bomic is helping the economy you have some really out of touch people at the upper echline of the Democrat leadership because they really think it's not that bad show them the headline on the homes um because I wanted to get Peter's take on this one so just three or four years ago if I'm getting the numbers correct uh you had to make at least and I could be off on this because I don't have the article in front of me but you had to make at least about 69,000 maybe it was 59,000 somewhere around 50 or 60 Grand to afford home ownership this was an average across the country obviously if you're in crazy expensive cities that doesn't adhere to you but this is average now you have to make 9,000 to afford a home just in four years it's skyrocketed and it all has been the majority obviously 3 years and three months under Joe Biden oh yeah and and not only is it going to get a lot more expensive to buy a home because mortgage rates are about to take another move up uh but it cost more to maintain the home once you buy it because Insurance costs are through the roof the maintenance costs have gone through the roof taxes are going up everything about home ownership is going up I mean some people are lucky because they they locked in a a fixed rate mortgage but the flip side of that is that all of our banks are insolvent uh because they own these mortgages and they're losing money on them yeah Peter my last question is an easy one I'm going to bring this headline up from Bloomberg you're always talking about the debt and how that's the biggest part if we keep printing money and spending money we don't have and putting the government into the country into more debt inflation will continue to rise so the Congressional budget office is warning big red flag the US federal government debt is on path from the current 97% of GDP last year to 116% by 2034 30 seconds left how detrimental is that for the future of our economic prosperity for this country Peter Shi they're even sugarcoating it because they're assuming we have no recessions and that interest rates don't explode I mean uh there we have a much bigger problem than they acknowledge that's why the price of gold is at a record high that's why it's going to keep going up and I think we're on the verge of a dollar crisis and a sovereign debt crisis so this is not a problem for our kids it's a problem that we're going to be dealing with and we're probably going to be dealing with it over the next several years oh my gosh okay listen next year at this time hopefully you and I are going to be saying a lot better things once we've got a new Administration and um you know who unleashes energy and changes regulation and does a whole bunch of things that'll get this country back on track I'm praying I'm crossing my fingers every single day Peter Schiff thank you brother okay

the oil prices went up relative to everything else but the general price level never changed much in Japan I got Professor I'm a good student I agree with everything you just said I you you misunderstood my point I'm not saying that Rising oil prices cause inflation they don't but what they do do is factor into the CPI which measures inflation so what I'm saying is one of the main reasons that the CPI went down from up 9% year-over up 3% was because you had a pullback in commodity prices and so that reflects in that but the the overall rise in oil and other commodity prices that is going to continue in 2024 and Beyond is inflation inflation is what's causing prices the you can't you can't have it both ways I'm not having it both ways no you are let me give you another L you you are you're you're absolutely wrong on this and let me tell you why we're pleased to present to you a panel between two favorites on the show Professor Steve hanky Professor for Applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and Peter Schiff Chief Market strategist of europacific asset management and chairman of schift gold he's also the author of several books including crash proof 2.0 how to profit from the economic collapse we'll be discussing their outlook on inflation um economic growth monetary policy welcome both Peter and Professor hanky good to see you thanks for inviting us on yeah great to see you and great to see Peter also yes straight from Puerto Rico well uh gentlemen uh you you're both uh Titans in your respective spaces feel free to converse with each other I'm just here to facilitate the conversation let's begin with the topic of inflation as I believe both of you have differing views on where inflation may be headed Peter I'll start with you you recently tweeted that the longer the FED keeps interest rates at current levels the larger federal budget deficits grow Rising deficit spending adds to the upboard pressures on consumer prices this pressure will increase when Rising deficits lead to a weaker dollar higher rates equals higher inflation Peter can you walk us through uh the transmission mechanism here why will interest rates necessarily will higher interest rates necessarily lead to higher consumer prices and ultimately where do you see inflation headed yeah well first of all too remember inflation is not just an expansion of the money supply but also the supply of credit CU consumers could buy us credit just as if they had actual cash and that's what's been going on you know even though the FED has raised interest rates people keep on borrowing and spending household debt at record highs credit card debt record highs uh government debt deficits running at a record Pace uh so the FED has really had no effect on slowing down credit growth and all of this is is fueling in inflation but the the the box that the FED is now in is if raising interest rates is their tool for fighting inflation apart from the fact that interest rates are also a cost that businesses have to pass on to their customers just like rents or raw materials or labor or any other cost the problem for the government is as interest rates go up budget deficits automatically go up because it costs the US government a lot more money to refinance all the maturing debt plus to finance all the new debt and to the extent that that increase in interest rates uh dampens the economy it also leads to a reduction in tax revenue an increase in other government spending and so the FED ends up driving the budget deficits even higher and that ultimately is the source of inflation because it's the Federal Reserve that ends up monetizing all that government debt that is you know what's driving the problem and I think ultimately as our budget deficits are exploding it's going to cause a a big loss of confidence in the dollar and us treasuries and so as the dollar starts to fall that puts even more upward pressure on consumer prices uh because the you know the dollar now has less value internationally and so you know everything that you buy is going to be more expensive okay Professor hanky I'll let you answer the same question and then I'll give Peter Peter a chance to respond what is your view on inflation walk us through your thesis of how the money supply affects inflation well the money supply dominates and since money supply has been contracting for quite some time actually since March of 2022 it's contracted by a little over 4% which is not totally unprecedented but almost to almost completely unprecedented we've only had four contractions ever in the money supply since the Fed was established in 1913 and we have to go way back to the 1940s to even find the first contraction uh 48 49 it contracted then we go back into the 30s 37 38 it contracted and then of course a huge contraction in 2933 that was a great depression and we had another contraction in 2022 so they're rare and we haven't seen them for a long time and every time they've occurred in the past we not only have had a recession actually one depression out of the four that I mentioned the other three we had pretty good recessions so that's an economic slowdown which we'd expect from the slowing of the money supply and contraction of the money supply but but also remember that there's a sequence of things that happen after there's a significant change in the money supply the first thing asset prices change and then with another longer lag the economic activity changes course and then with longest lag inflation and inflation John Greenwood and I anticipate that it's it's going to continue to go down even though we've had a little little stickiness here the last three months and and we'll go down to the Target level or if not below by probably not the Target now by the end of the year uh with these last three months of sticky inflation it's probably going to push that two % level off until sometime early in 2025 but that that's all really baked in the cake ites it doesn't matter what the fed's doing now it's already happened because monetary policy has an effect on things with very long and very V highly variable lags so so that's more or less my picture it's a little bit different than what Peter was talking about inflation going up let me let me ask you a question Professor though you're talking about the the recent decline in money supply but what about the unprecedented expansion that occurred prior to that how much did money supply grow before it began to contract well it it it it was it was totally unprecedented Peter actually the the the increase that was uh that we saw uh in February of 2021 the money supply actually was is increasing at a 27% year-over-year rate that's the highest in history and and as a result of this huge surge in the money supply after the pandemic hit in early 2020 we we had a massive overhang of excess cash balances and and that's now actually been drained out of the system it it just was drained out of the system wasn't the money Supply also expanding for many many years before that oh very small very slow rates the golden growth the money supply hanky's golden growth rates about 6% per year and that's consistent with hitting a 2% inflation Target so if it was growing at 6% per year measured by M2 the broad money measure you you you feed the real growth in the economy you feed the natural increase inrease in the demand for cash balances and that that increases normally about 1.7% per year more or less 2% and the potential growth rate in the economy is more or less 2% and the inflation Target is 2% so 2 plus 2 plus two is about 6% that keeps you on an even kill and that that's why we had what we had in the 1990s by the way well that's what was going on in the 19 1990s had go ahead isn't it impossible though that there was enough inflation I think in the pipeline before uh money supplies started to contract although the entire time credit continued to grow which is obviously part of the real money supply is what people can can can use with credit but what if there is a big backlog of inflation that hasn't even fully worked its way into the price structure yet so I don't know that we've even caught up to the inflation that was created before we saw the contraction money supply and again if credit continue to expand the entire time I don't see how the upward pressure on prices is going to Abate well you you've got to if if you look at the money supply you're incorporating the effects of credit so I'm I'm I'm looking I think at what the relevant measure is money money dominates and and back to this de deficit thing we we have a little so so there wasn't you're you you're making a conjecture that there was a excess amount of cash balances that were out there beforehand that's not true and then you can measure that by measure just dividing GDP nominal GDP in into the money supply M2 and that gives you the cash balance it's just the it's the reciprocal of velocity and if you do that there there wasn't any excess what so what you're saying is this not correct and and and and if you look at the deficit too deficits don't necessarily cause inflation money dominates it's all about the money supply now deficits can you mentioned the word monetize if the deficit was monetized and therefore the the FED is buying treasury Securities from the non-bank public in that case obviously the money supply goes up and inflation is go well that well that's exactly what it did with quantitative easing I mean that was what it was they they bought trillion doll worth of treasuries morgage back Securities not not that's what that's what happened the last quantitative easing not the first the the the the post Leman crash that we had the did did not end up in inflation and many people are confused about that we had quantitative easing and the fed's balance sheet exploded and a lot of people said oh we're going to have a tremendous amount of inflation because of this well the fed's contribution to what I call the state money contribution to the money supply M2 was exploding but at that same time remember the banks were bad Dodd Frank would put a noose around their neck bosel 3 Capital requirements put a noose around their neck and the bank contribution the the the most important elephant in the room or Banks and you you keep talking about credit it's it's Bank credit that that's who makes the money supply most of the money supply is actually created by the commercial banking system have a lot after after Leman collapsed their contribution went negative because of huge Bank regulations coming in from dodf Frank as well as on the top of that you had bosil 3 coming and and so that affected it now the deficit let us just be clear about this to to clarify this the best way to look at it is look at Japan ja Japan has a massive has since 1990 had a massive fiscal deficit and they have no inflation and and the reason they have no inflation is because the money supply is growing way below the go my golden growth rate for Japan is about 5% growth and it's it's grow been growing about 2% well first of all you know we have a lot more debt than we had when Leman failed I mean debt has exploded and we didn't get all that QE for free I think we did create inflation a lot of it went into Financial assets temporarily I think there has been a big lag and I also don't think the government measures inflation properly so it's hard to tell exactly uh the effects that inflation has had on price when your CPI is flawed by Design and doesn't really capture the degree to which prices are rising but I also disagree that Japan doesn't have an inflation problem they do uh even by their own measures it's running you know 2 3% but again I'm sure that there's a lot of flaws in the way the Japanese measure it but again you have to look at what might have happened because you can't just look at prices going up maybe prices should have gone down maybe without the government creation of inflation uh consumers would have benefited from lower prices and they didn't get lower prices they were robbed to those price declines by the government that created inflation and so maybe instead of buying things for 2 or 3% less they ended up spending two or 3% more but that's five or six% inflation not 2% yeah but Peter you're you're you're you're redefining everything here which is just a mass of confusion there was no there was no inflation essentially in Japan by any traditional measure since 1990 the numbers that we the most recent numbers we have it it it's ticked up just a little bit but we how are you defining inflation I'm defining at the same way the bank of Japan defines it or or I I'm just asking how you define it not how a government defines it because I think governments misde Define it they they the governments want the public to believe that inflation is created uh by outside factors by greedy corporations by economic growth by employment uh by all sorts of things but if you go back to old that's the way they do that's not the way you you haven't read some of the work that John Greenwood and I have done as monetarist there's only one thing that causes inflation and that's changes in the money supply and that doesn't just cause inflation that is inflation what is being inflated is the money supply you go back and get an old dictionary even in the in the in the 7s you get a dictionary Webster's Dictionary look up inflation and it says an expansion of the money supply and it's also money and credit Rising prices are a result a consequence of inflation they are not inflation and they do not cause inflation they are a byproduct of inflation okay we we agree you're just spit spitting out forget the dictionary go to lve on mises or any good Austrian and you'll find the definition that you you start by changes in the money Supply here I and and that leads to changes in prices in the general price level and corre and right now uh we're uh in a situation where many many people talk including you about Stag flation and and the real uh dean of that the expert on it godfried Von hobler a a great Austrian Economist this is his book I'm holding up right now that's that's a little Bible on stag inflation and what causes it and the inflation part of it is caused by changes in the money supply and as hobbler says and I'm reading on I'm reading I'm reading off of hobbler right now and Hubler indicates that no significant inflation has ever occurred in which the prices the price level is went up by 4% or more for more than two years if there wasn't as he said a significant increase in the change in the money supply prior to that yeah well we certainly have had a big increase in the money supply but I think I think the future increase is going to be greater because we're heading towards a a fiscal explosion interest on the national debt is now about 1.1 trillion a year by next year it's going to be you're you're looking into crystal ball I'm looking in the reality of what's actually happen need crystal ball to do this math no it isn't math it isn't you're wrong and you're wrong just look at Japan Japan has had a massive increase in their debt and in their fiscal deficits problem highest ratio in the world and they have not had inflation because they have they've not increased the money supply adequately they've had a deficiency in the growth of the money supply that's that's why they've they theyve never had an inflation problem since they they have one now just with their own statistics but look what's happening to the Yen I mean the yen is almost at 160 to the dollar of course it's falling against all currencies uh prices are going up I mean how how could they not have an inflation problem let me just ask uh Peter uh and just to follow up what you said and we'll go one at a time here Peter you just said that the FED is likely to expand their monetary policy once again because of the deficit problem right are you suggesting we're going to get QE again are you suggesting that they're gonna yeah I I I think the the most recent Announcement by the FED that they're tapering their quantitative tightening program uh they're going down from 95 billion a month to 60 billion this is the first step in a return to quantitative easing because the FED is going to have to choose between government defaulting on its obligations or slashing spending on Social Security Medicare government pensions or monetizing that debt because there is no way that the government can Finance it at current interest rates and you know the only way they can get interest rates down really is to go back to QE they're going to have to start buying more government bonds to artificially supress rates and so inflation is going to explode I mean those are the choices we can have default and deflation or we can print and have massive inflation but from a political perspective I think that's the only viable choice that the FED is going to make and even if poell didn't want to make it he's going to be under tremendous pressure to make it uh by the Biden Administration or whatever Administration even the Trump Administration would you know they you know would would do that nobody wants uh to see you know government spending you know cut dramatically nobody wants the US have to honestly default on on its debt could they just raise taxes Peter could they just raise couldn't they just raise taxes Peter on who I mean if if they raise taxes on the rich who are already paying a tremendous amount of taxes I don't know how much additional Revenue they're likely to get in fact they may even lose Revenue depending on how they do it what we need is consumption based taxes uh like a national sales tax or a higher payroll tax but no one's going to vote for that I mean no one's going to tax middle class and the middle class has already broke uh people have no savings they've maxed out on credit card debt uh and they're working two or three jobs how you going to tell middle class voters that on top of all this pain we're going to significantly raise your taxes I mean it's just just politically it's a non-starter so the the path of lease resistance is to print right and then they're going to blame the inflation on somebody else right speculators greedy businessmen Putin OBC I mean they always Point fing ERS because they've redefined inflation as rising prices and so the government doesn't R raise prices they point to all the people who are raising prices and they blame them for the inflation okay perfect Professor hanky same question to you what is the likely course of monetary policy and do you agree with Peter that more easing is to come which would cause inflation again we we can talk about possible scenarios but I I'm not in the crystal ball business and I if we have an unsustainable deficit right now any everyone concludes this even the nonpartisan Congressional budget office concludes this is not sustainable we we cannot continue with the current structure that we have right now so how do you change that well one thing you can do is tax and there are two ways to tax you can have an inflation tax and that would be by monetizing a big chunk of the debt possible and you can have direct taxes where where Peter and I get whacked with with an increasing tax bill and and so do so do other Americans I'm in Puerto Rico so I'm immune well you yeah okay well you've taken care you've taken care you're you've been vaccinated so so so so so the question is what what are they going to do the deficit is not sustainable everyone agrees they can tax to close the deficit and and that taxing will be either an inflation tax or increases in direct taxation the other thing they could do is control government spending and put a cap on spending so so those are the only three possibilities and you don't need a crystal ball to know which one they're going to pick because there's no precedent for cutting spending there's no precedent for raising taxes on the I mean it's just I mean they have raised taxes just hang on hang on you you you you're making a lot of statements here that are generalities that are not precise and one of them is you can't cut government spending and Bill Clinton was the most conservative fiscal we've ever had and Clinton did cut government spending as a percent of GDP by a much greater uh percentage than any other president since World War II Eisenhower did a little bit and and Reagan did a little bit by the by the end of the second term of Reagan right but they didn't cut Social Security they didn't cut Medicare that's what needs to be cut now changing the topic I'm talking about the de about the budget I I refuse I know but I'm talking about what needs to be cut in order to make a difference I'm talking about what Clinton cut let's talk about Bill Clinton for a minute you you made a statement and the statement was incorrect you said you can't cut spending Clinton did cut it still went we we we we had a a definite significant reduction in government spending as a proportion of GDP the private sector became bigger under Clinton and the government sector became smaller under Clinton and we had n gri in the Congress and we had Bill Clinton in the White House and these Cuts occurred and as a result that the last two terms the last two years of Clinton's second term we actually had budget surpluses and everybody was panicked that the government wouldn't be putting out any treasuries there wouldn't be any liquidity in the market and and we'd have we'd have Chaos on Wall Street remember I remember I I remember those statements and I was laughing what a great problem that would be to have but I knew that it wasn't going to happen because these projections were pie in the sky but you know even the years of the surpluses those one or two years that those were accounting Sur pluses the national debt itself went up each year that we supposedly had a surplus so a lot of it is because the government just doesn't count uh some of the spending they claim it's off budget and so they can pretend they have a surplus but I will grant you that fiscally under the combination of Clinton gridge uh we we didn't uh do nearly as bad as we did under uh Bush Jr and under Obama and and under Trump and under Biden but I don't see any realistic return to any kind of fiscal responsibility especially given the gravity of the problem now that is so much bigger than it was uh when Clinton was President and the fact that now in order to have any meaningful success you're going to have to gore all the sacred cows you're going to have to make cuts to Social Security Medicare um government pensions now not in the future going to tell people that in the future let me summarize what you're saying what you're saying is very simple you you say we have a a big fiscal deficit problem you H H hanky and and Peter agree that we we have a big we have a big problem there only there are only two ways to solve that from the fiscal point of view and that is one you cut government spending you say that's impossible it's never happened before I say well it did happen under under Clinton and and griid uh they did get things under control you you and I also say if you had a constitutional convention under Article Five you could change the Constitution and and put in a Swiss debt break so so so there are there are things that could be done you don't think they're going to be done to to tap uh the break on government spending so okay fine so then what's left then what's left you can tax and there are only two ways to tax to close it and that is increasing direct taxes and and Peter says no that's not going to happen and and you're left with the the only thing left and that's an inflation tax that that's the that's the taxonomy of what we're talking about here well that is my point and also what makes it so hard to cut spending now is the biggest line item in the budget next year is going to be interest on the national debt and you can't cut that unless you're going to default so if you take interest on the national debt off the table the this has exploded it's higher than defense spending is right now and next year it'll be higher than Social Security Medicare the the national debt is almost growing by a trillion a quarter it's it's exponential this is all this is all be this is all because of in in inappropriate a disastrous monetary policy by the Fed I agree that has created the problem that we are in now it it is not on the it's not on the fiscal side Peter as you imply it is because of the fed and the monetary side policy dominates the FED enabled the deficit spending the FED should have been more independent they should have had much higher interest rates they never should have done quantitative easing they should be putting pressure on Congress to cut the deficit spending uh just like vulker used to do they're not doing it pal is hiding behind this phony uh claim of independent fed means you can't criticize uh fiscal policy you can't you can't criticize deficit spending he has enabled it he has encouraged it and not just him but his predecessors so yes that defend has been the big problem but it takes two to tango it's def I'll let Professor hany close and then we'll move on to another subject yeah please go ahead okay not the the the this is this is something you've kind of alluded to that that I want to clar another thing I want to clarify more than anything else I'm in a clarifying mode here and that is that the idea and the propaganda that was put out by the fed and the White House and the Congress that nonmonetary factors caused the inflation problem that we we've gotten ourselves into like oil for example that Putin oil supply side shocks all this all this rubbish and it's it's pure rubbish what caused it is the explosion in the money supply that went up at the peak 27% year-over-year in early 2021 we've never seen it that high before and as night follows day when the money supply explodes like that with a long and variable lag you get inflation and that's exactly what John Greenwood and I predicted would happen what what compounded it and I predicted it too just like you did in real time not only did they make the mistake of flooding the economy with money they also told people to stop working stay home don't be productive so the supply of goods and services to buy went down as the demand went up because we gave everybody money to buy stuff that nobody was producing well and so worse this this is this this is absolutely true now and and and and what is amazing with all of this you you read in the newspapers from the start of the pandemic when the money supply started going out of control to today and Paul has done a brilliant job of sweeping all of these problems under the rug he he's gotten off I think Scott free and and the Press never mentions anything about the money all they talk they go prattle on and on about all these non-monetary factors and and and the reason that the the reason why inflation's getting better it isn't because of the the money supply Contracting and get getting under control it's because the supply chains have been fixed we have all that fixed now and and and everybody everybody takes this in you cannot pick up any financial newspaper without seeing a rendition of all these non-monetary factors so all the the all these Central Bankers all of them not just Paul have really gotten off the hook on this thing they've they've conned the Press into repeating well that's because the Press is a propaganda machine for the government the Press wants to make sure the public doesn't realize that the source of inflation is the government because the public is talking about how inflation is the big problem well it's government that's the big problem because government causes it I mean I remember uh Gerald Ford when he was president declared inflation Public Enemy Number One but since the government causes inflation then the government was Public Enemy Number One but also what helped bring down the CPI I think was the rise in the dollar we had a big increase in the Dollar on the anticipation of Fed rate hikes that brought down commodity prices especially Energy prices plus the The Dumping of oil from the Strategic petroleum Reserve so we had big correction in commodity prices that took a lot of pressure off headline CPI but if you look year-to date Commodities are exploding uh including oil and I think the dollar roll you gotta stay Peter you got to stay with principles on the commodity thing first of all I agree about the Press you gotta check Hank's 95% rule is 95% of what you read in the financial press is either wrong or irrelevant but let's go to oil and these commodity prices you you've got that wrong too that that those are changes in relative prices we we have Commodities and services those are two big sectors and and one one is one is going up and one one goes down up up down down the general price level has been going up and then going sinking and going down and and the best example I like to give about the oil by the way and this myth about oil prices causing inflation is Japan in the 1970s we we had two oil crises in the 1970s and the first one in 73 the Embargo in 1973 the bank of Japan said oh oil prices are going up and of course they they import all our oil in Japan yeah and the bank of Japan concluded we have to accommodate that so we'll increase the money supply well inflation went up and everybody said oh you see oil prices caused inflation to go up then in 79 the second time we had a spike in the 70s with oil an oil crisis the bank of Japan says no we're not going to play ball this time we're not going to artificially increase the money supply to accommodate this and of course they didn't have inflation the oil prices went up relative to everything else but the general price level never changed much in Japan I got Professor I'm a good student I agree with everything you just said I you you misunderstood my point I'm not saying that Rising oil prices cause inflation they don't but what they do do is factor into the CPI which measures inflation so what I'm saying is one of the main reasons that the CPI went down from up 9% year-over-year to up 3% was because you had a pullback in commodity prices and so that reflects in that but the the overall rise in oil and other commodity prices that is going to continue in 2024 and Beyond is inflation inflation is what's causing commodity prices you can't you can't have it both ways you I'm not having it both ways no you are let me give you another L not you you are you're you're absolutely wrong on this and let me tell you why you first have been arguing that non-monetary factors are nonsense and rubbish and and don't cause inflation and now you're arguing non monetary factors like changes in commodity prices are causing inflation no I'm not I'm not I'm not arguing that at all you're missing my point it's the monetary expansion that caused oil prices to go up and commodity prices I'm just saying that we had a temporary drop in oil prices and commodity prices as the dollar went up all these Goods all these Commodities are priced in dollars so as the dollar went up that brought down oil prices in dollars that brought down commodity pric in dollars that temporarily helped the CPI go down right but now uh those commodity prices are are resuming their rise because of inflation and so the impact they had on making the CPI look better is gone it's in the rearview mirror I want to talk about economic see that but the inflation is the money supply I agree with you 100% it's money and credit being expanded by the government that's where all the excess demand is coming from perfect I want to talk about economic growth Peter isn't possible that to fix a deficit problem you just need to grow the economy faster right in theory could we have an economic boom that could just by itself kind of Rectify the deficit problem that we've been having well I mean in theory anything is possible right I mean May phras the question is that your view that we're gonna get some yeah there you go yeah I mean look we would have to have a tremendous increase in economic growth to bail us out of this problem of course if we didn't have the problem then the economic growth would be a a much bigger windfall right for Americans uh but is it possible that we can grow the economy so much that we can actually afford uh these massive deficits I mean I I mean maybe but is it likely is it even a realistic possibility I don't think so uh and and the debt at this point is just growing exponentially that is the problem and much higher interest rates are necessary than the rates we have right now do you think we're going to get a recession Peter Still excuse me do you think we'll still get a recession year I think look I I believe we're in a recession I just don't believe a lot of the numbers that we get from the government I know that the Great Recession of 2008 uh they they it began in December of 07 but they didn't officially acknowledge it until December of '08 and they went back and they revised an entire Year's worth of data uh to show that we had been in recession for the entire year a and even up until mid 2008 most economists and Wall Street strategists didn't see a recession coming even though we were in the middle of of the Great Recession so I think uh something similar could be going on and I also think that the weakness in the economy this uh stealth uh recession is the reason that Biden and Harris are so unpopular and if you look at these polls uh where they score lowest is on the economy and so how could they be blamed for a lousy economy if the economy is great which is what the politicians are telling us and and Wall Street and and the bankers but uh the the public is telling us that it's not good because if it was good they would be crediting a Biden uh but they're not they're blaming him because his lousy so I think we have recession I think we have inflation which means we're already in stag flation I just think we have a lot of stag and a lot of flation despite the fact that a pal claims to see no evidence of either okay Professor hanky what's your view on whether or not we're going to get a recession and economic growth well I I already said due to the fact that we had this monetary contraction and we've only had four like this in history and they all led to recessions or depressions we're we're going to have a Slowdown and and a recession and and it looks like now green wouldn't I think this will probably be early in 2025 but on the growth potential thing again if you read the press and and you're reading quotations people talking their own book from Silicon Valley about AI increasing productivity and all this stuff they they actually think that the growth in the US economy the potential might go up to 6% per year this this is just total nonsense this is this is not going to happen the potential growth rate long run in the United States is about 2.2% something like that and if you look at the policies that we have there are five pillars for Prosperity you've got to look at taxes what's going to happen with taxes well I I think unlike Peter I think taxes are going up probably so that's bad that that's that's going to hold back Prosperity government restraints that's restraint on government spending that that's probably probably not going to happen unless we get a constitutional amendment so that's that's a negative monetary policy I think we have a problem because we have this big deficit that Peter and I are both worried about and the CBO says it's unsustainable and one way to eliminate that unsustainable deficit is an inflation tax so that means a monetary policy is going to be vulnerable to monetizing some of this the fourth thing is regulation and and regulation's getting worse more red tape more red tape that holds back the potential and the last thing is international trade and we've got more and more protectionism more and more sanctions and that's going to hold back competition productivity and potential growth so if you look at the Five Pillars taxes are probably going to get worse government spending is probably going to get worse monetary policy is probably not going to be fully corrected and and not not be helpful regulatory policies more and more red tape that's bad and international trade more protectionism so if you look over the landscape of the Five Pillars they're they're all pretty shaky they're all right any way you cut it and mix them up there's there's nothing in those five pillars I I don't think Peter would would argue with me there I don't think there's anything in those five things that I said Peter that you think is going to get better goad Peter no they're they're all going to get worse I agree uh yes they they may they may get some tax increases that will mainly fall on higher income people but uh those taxes will mainly diminish investment rather than consumption so if you just raise taxes and the result is that wealthy people invest Less in in productivity enhancing uh you know Capital because they're not going to you know reduce their consumption if you raise taxes on the Millionaires and billionaires they're not going to stop spending money on entertainment and food and travel they're going to invest less and that's not how you fight inflation by diminishing investment Capital you have to go after consumption and none of the politicians are going to do that but what's the most problematic and you you'd have to agree is that if you're right and I'm right you know we do have a recession coming whether it's a Slowdown or an actual recession we know how the government is going to respond the minute we're officially in a recession we're going to get stimulus regardless of where the inflation rate is there's going to be uh some type of program to stimulate the economy government is going to increase spending even more with stimulus checks or some type of programs the fed's going to want to cut rates and and and do something because now we're in recession and unemployment is going up but all this is happening with record budget deficits even before before we juice them and the automatically you know when when you're in a recession automatically the deficits get bigger because you have less tax revenue you have more expenditures that automatically kick in and you got this massive deficits already there so we we've never gone into a recession in anywhere near the vulnerable fiscal position that we're in right now let me just play a clip here from uh Jared Bernstein chair of the Council of economic advisers have you okay you've seen this I don't I don't know if that's sad or funny you know or or or scary but I don't think Professor I don't think Professor hanky has seen this because I think you're both um talking about what the government will do and I I don't know if people you know we should take a look at this clip and see what the government actually is thinking about right now like you said they print the dollar so why why does the government even borrow well um the uh so the I mean again some of this stuff gets some of the language that the M some of the language and concepts are just confusing I mean the government definitely prints money and it definitely lends that money which is why the government definitely prints money and then it lends that money by uh by selling bonds uh is that what they do they they um they yeah they they um they sell bonds yeah they sell bonds right since they sell bonds and people buy the bonds and lend them the money yeah so a lot of times a lot of times at least to my year with with mmt the the language and the concepts can be kind of unnecessarily confusing but there is no question the government prints money and then it uses that money to um uh uh uh so um yeah I I guess I'm just I don't I can't really talk I don't I don't get it I don't know what they're talking about like cuz it's like the government clearly prints money it does it all the time and it clearly borrows otherwise we wouldn't be having this dead and deist conversation so I don't think there's anything confusing there I want to get Professor Hank's reaction to that already it he's talking he he's he us the acronym M mmt that's modern monetary Theory and basically if you boil all of it down the mumbo jumbo and everything modern monetary Theory simply says that deficits don't matter now pet Peter and I have pretty we we we might agree disagree on all kinds of nuances and so forth but we we agree on one big thing deficits do matter all right I want to get I wan okay I want to off now one one thing just one thing Peter said that I he said it two two different times and that is that we had to have if we had a consumption tax now um when when we were talking about increasing taxes and and let me just say that they they have a consumption tax in in Europe generally it's called vat the value added tax in my view that's the stupidest tax and so these consumption taxes that you could possibly dream up and that is one reason and one big reason by the way that Europe is lagging way behind the United States is because of the vat tax I think it's that well they also have five the five of of of prosperity are nothing more than Reaganomics and of course I know a little bit about this because I was on Reagan's Council of economic advisors and the Five Pillars are Reaganomics taxes do you have do you have good taxes government restraint monetary stability regul regulation and deregulation International Trade free trade versus protectionism so so the I I I I am not a consumption tax fan at all or a vat thing well the the main reason that I think a lot of European nations are lagging is not because they have a vat it's because they also have an income tax and they also have a big social welfare system and a lot of regulations now yeah I would prefer a sales tax to a vat because it's more transparent but that's why governments like Vats because it's not as obvious uh how high the how high the cost is but I would much rather run an economy on a consumption tax and a tax on work and production and income uh that's not the way to do it and it's a much fairer easier uh uh comp tax system to comply with you don't have to keep books and Records you don't have to you know uh you know have all these loopholes and uh various ways to try to get around the tax that's the that's the type of tax system that the founding fathers envisioned that's why they made the requirement to a portion direct taxes the US government was supposed to run on on excise taxes not direct taxes but but my point was that if we raise taxes and just do it on incomes uh it's going to be counterproductive economically uh we need to I would rather not raise taxes at all I would rather slash government spending but but you know you're preaching you're preaching to the choir here I I was one of the original Supply Siders so you don't have to tell me about the all right negative so we probably agree on income I'd like to finish off on um yeah let me make one point that you played that Bernstein clip he didn't answer the question because he doesn't know how to answer it and he doesn't he's not even sure what a a loan is versus borrowing he first he said the government was lending money no it was borrowing money was when when it sells bonds but the he didn't answer the question as to why we don't just print money why do we even borrow well because when we borrow money we're borrowing money that already exists it's not inflationary in and of itself uh we can take money out of the economy and and put it back in but when the government just prints money that's inflation so yes you can you can run the government and without it borrowing money in fact you could get rid of all legitimate taxes we don't have to have an income tax we don't have to have a sales tax the government can just print all the money it needs and just spends it but that doesn't mean we get government for free all that means is we're going to pay much higher prices for everything we buy we're going to pay for government through inflation through higher prices rather than through taxation so that is how he should have answered the question the reason we borrow is so we don't have inflation he he clearly doesn't understand how the money supply is measured by M2 actually exists the the the government only it's a small player in printing money 11% 11% 11% of M2 is made up of notes and coins 76% is made up by liquid deposits at commercial Banks commercial banks are the elephant in the room they produce most of the money is produced by commercial Banks and you then then you have a little bit that's that's F fed is the enabler there what well the FED enables that though let let's just finish off on and the deposit Insurance the government Deposit Insurance the FDIC there there there's a whole mass of regulatory structure that that that governs Banking and and the FED is just one small part of that but there there there're many many aspects and most people don't understand monetary policy is is actually something that's in put in place by by many actors in Washington besides the FED every everybody who regulates the commercial banking system is involved in in fact monetary policy and and and that's why commercial banking system is basically insolvent it's because of government uh mismanagement manipulation the uh uh you know we're just you know one crisis away from a complete implosion in in the banks because the banks thanks to the government and thanks to uh Deposit Insurance they're loaded up on long-term debt that yields 2 3 4% uh and you know to the extent that the FED actually has to raise interest rates to a a realistic level all these Banks fail I mean you know sitting here with a mountain of bad debt that they're that they're not marking to the market because they're pretending they can hold it all to maturity but they may not be able to do that there may are are we getting a banking crisis that was my next question Ste uh Professor hanky are we getting a banking crisis can you address Peter's Point are we are we going to see a banking crisis yeah is is there is another one unfolding a bigger one again I I I I'm not I'm not in that kind of crystal ball Zone I can tell you where the economy is going it's going to slow down we're going to have a recession do some banks get into trouble and some financial institutions as well as individuals when that happens and the answer is yes okay uh Peter what's what are your what are your what's your outlook on we'll finish off here what's your outlook on uh the dollar interest rates and gold given your economic Outlook well you know I think that regardless of what the FED does they should be hiking rates uh they're more likely to reduce them somewhat but I think regardless long-term interest rates are going higher uh bond yields will move up uh because I do believe the dollar is going to roll over uh and I think the the selling pressure on treasuries is going to continue to mount uh not only from uh the government trust funds which are now big sellers like Social Security you know they have to sell treasuries because they don't collect enough taxes to cover the the the the you know the cost but but I think you're going to see a bigger Exodus of central banks particularly uh in the Emerging Markets The Brick Nations I think they're going to accelerate their gold buying in fact as the price of gold moves higher and higher they're going to have to spend more dollars to buy that gold uh they have a lot of dollars on their books to get rid of uh and to replace with gold uh so I think you're going to continue to see gold prices rise at some point investors are going to start buying gold too uh competing with these central banks so I think the trajectory of uh the increase is going to accelerate and that's you know the canary and the coal mine for the dollar I think you know gold is the main competitor to the dollar as a reserve asset and as gold prices really start to rise you're basically seeing uh the the gold value of your dollar reserves plunge that's going to put more pressure to dollarize it's already there based on the sanctions too that we put on on Russia you have a political motivation not just an economic motivation to you know uh reduce your uh your Reliance and dependence on the US dollar uh so I think the dollar is going down I think bond yields are rising I think the price of gold is going up and uh this is also going to be very problematic for the US economy because higher interest rates and higher inflation are going to be a big problem that are going to exacerbate the severity of the next recession which of course the FED is going to try to fight by going back to its uh monetary Playbook of creating more inflation because you have to understand the way the FED fights recession is by cre inflation that's what it does you know it creates inflation but when you have an inflationary recession when inflation is the cause of the recession how are you going to fix that you know with more inflation it's it's not going to work it's going to backfire for sure Professor hanky can you address the dollarization issue that Peter brought up um is the dollar in trouble for the reasons that he stated well it's it's very close to its all-time high on on the weighted average it's been very strong for quite some time so we we we again if you read the press and listen to what's in the press all they talk about is dollarization and the fact that the reserve status of the dollar has been shrinking which it has by the way but uh the dollar remains up at the all-time high right now and I don't see any uh change in the near future for that as far as gold as you know I've been a gold bull for a long time and it's going up and Peter mentioned the Central Bank buying and that that part of that is a dollarization story but the real story is retail buying in China this is all a China story The Go gold going up it's it's not really a central bank story it's really what is what is a cutting edge here it it is not non-chinese Retail non-chinese non-central Bank buying that's actually gone down the retail buying at the at the non-chinese non- Central Bank level is is muted now it's it's if anything slightly on the weak side neutrals are slightly weak but the Chinese buying on the retail non- Central Bank side has been extremely strong and I think it will continue as far as the Chinese the Chinese are smart they're ahead of the curve well yeah they they might be but on the on the bond yields I don't agree with what Peter's conclusion is that bond yields will be going up they'll be going down because bond yields long-term bond yields always follow inflation and inflation's coming down not up Peter says it's going up it's going down and and and when I'm saying that I'm saying we know that for let's say through 2025 because of what has happened before with the money supply the these changes in the money supply cause things to change with long and variable lags like inflation and and that's baked in the cake I already know that's happening this isn't a crystal ball thing it's almost what's also baked in the cake is that they're going to start you know gunning the money supply again I mean that's you know and then and then in a couple years in a couple years you might if if they did what you just said then you would have more inflation in a couple years out I said I'm I'm very precise here Peter I said 2025 that's what's baked in the cake beyond that we don't know because we don't know what's going to be happening to the money supply in the next quarter next half a year or so forth that will determine what's gonna happen I think that you know as the economy weakens they're going to have to go back to to QE but in the meantime you know you're talking about the a strong dollar it it's it's weak it's just less weak than the Euro and the pound and the Yen you're just measuring it relative to another fiat currency but if you look at it relative to purchasing power here in the United States if you look at the dollar relative to how much gold you can buy the dollar is weak the dollar is going down so but so is the Euro so is the pound so is the it depends on how it depends on how you measure it I'm just measuring it in a conventional way looking at all the currencies in the world yes it is it is the king and it is within 5% of it all it's about to be de dethroned that's what I think I think it's I think it's rain is coming to an end well you're you're in the de you're you're a dollariz or you're in that you're you're you're you're repeating what you read in the Press no no I I I I'm not reading the Press I'm saying this on my own I don't pay attention since let me help let me help you because I read the Press very carefully is is anyone investing should be doing even though 95% of what you read in the Press is either wrong or irrelevant as a contr IND the 5% can be extremely valuable if you know what you're doing and I'm just saying that you're echoing what's in the press okay I press is echoing me let's finish maybe maybe they're reading Peter shift let me finish off on one final point I think something you both agree on Peter isn't the dollar going to get dethroned by Bitcoin I mean per your argument bitcoin's outperformed everything as a currency like why aren't you are you buying Bitcoin I haven't asked you in a year Well you you you know Bitcoin is a non event it's a sideshow I mean it's important to the people who have bought it and it's they're going to end up losing a lot of money if they don't sell it but somebody's got to get caught holding the bag because somebody's going to own it when the Music Stops but I you know I think it's a sideshow I don't think it I think it's completely irrelevant um to what's going to happen I mean central banks are not going to buy it's not going to replace you know gold or you know let alone it's not going to replace any of these Fiat currencies let alone replace gold we're talking we're we're talking about a sideshow that occurs in some place like Las Vegas as I've said since day one Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset with zero fundamental value yeah we agree 100% all right I I end of discussion there I guess okay thank you both gentlemen for for for a very thorough discussion where can we follow your work Peter uh well you can follow me on uh you know on social media I do my own podcast at Peter shift show it's on shift radio.com on my YouTube channel you can follow me on on X you know now I have over a million followers so I do a lot of posting there I do my own posts uh if you're interested you know we both agree on gold uh call my Representatives at shift gold you go to shift gold.com that's my goal company and if you have a larger portfolio that you'd like me to manage you can see above my shoulder that's the website for my asset management company where we manage five mutual funds as well as individual portfolios I think it's important that people prepare uh for what's to come and and and recognize that the Dynamics that have been at play for the last decade or so are changing dramatically and you can invest you know uh the way the way it worked in the past kind of like uh in the 196s you had a nifty50 but if you stuck with that portfolio you got slaughtered in the 1970s and I think think the same thing is going to happen to most investors in the coming decade so you got to make uh the type of switch that that we've made already at your Pacific Asset Management all right Professor hanky thank you very much where can we follow your work well going to going to X I'm not quite up over a million I've got 730,000 followers but you can follow me on X at uh Steve hanky that'll get get me on X and if you want my irregular District distributions of materials articles and whatnot you just send me an email at hanky jhu.edu all right we'll put the links for both uh Professor hanky and Peter Schiff uh in the links below so make sure to check both of them out thank you very much genten for both of your times we will speak again soon thank you hey great thanks

well after months of waiting silver finally broke out today I have been pounding the table on my podcast and also on the special videos that I've recorded for shift gold to buy silver ahead of the breakout because it appeared to me that a breakout was eminent well now that breakout is history but the good news is it's still early it's not too late to buy silver sure it would have been better to buy it before it broke out but buying it right after the breakout is almost as good it's a lot better than weighted silver closed today not only above $30 an ounce but above $31 an ounce it finished a week at around $31.50 although I still see it trading that's up better than 6 and a half% on the day silver is now up more than 30% so far in 202 for today's close is the highest price and the highest close for silver since February of 2013 and if you look at a chart it looks like the price is going to accelerate rapidly from here that's why I am recording this video but you know silver isn't the strongest metal year to date that honor goes to copper and it's not even precious copper was up about 4% today not quite as much as silver but it was up 33% so far in 2024 you know I looked at the 1970s the inflationary decade of the 1970s and if you look at what happened at Copper prices from 1970 through 19 80 copper didn't even move that much it only moved up about 90% during in the course of that 10 years now that's still a pretty big increase 9% a year right that's a lot of inflation that drove up the price of copper but so far this decade since 2020 before covid it actually got even cheaper if you measure it from the covid lows but I'm ignoring that if you just look at what's happened from 2020 to May 2024 we're already up 80% this decade isn't even half over you know a lot of people people say this isn't the 1970s they're right it's not it's much worse than the 1970s that's what copper is telling you in fact if I look at a chart of copper I think an explosive move is coming we may even get to $10 a pound it closed over $5 today think about 58 at $10 would represent a double from where it is right now but looking at the chart I think that kind of move can happen it may even happen as as soon as next year but even if it takes another two or three years for the price of copper to double that is a huge move and believe me if copper goes to $10 a pound silver is going to $100 an ounce probably higher and that means $31.50 is still cheap if you don't buy the breakout above $30 you may end up buying the breakout above $50 that could happen soon so I wouldn't wait I've been talking to the guys at shift gold and they've been telling me that a lot of our customers have been waiting for a pullback now if you've been listening to my podcast I've been advising people not to do that it's not worth it any pullbacks are going to be short and shallow it's not meaningful if you are a long-term buyer like if you want to trade silver or gold day trader oh sure yeah you got to be more strategic look for pullbacks but if you're day trading or even short-term trading you shouldn't be buying any physical silver or gold open up a Commodities account trade futures or buy an ETF at a uh you know discount broker that's what they're for they're for trading you don't trade physical gold and silver the transaction costs are too high what you do with physical gold and silver is you buy it and you keep it and you keep it until you need it not until you sell it a lot of people are going to need their precious metals especially their silver they're going to need it because it may be the only monetary instrument that other people may accept in exchange for goods and services we have a real currency crisis we have hyperinflation which is a distinct possibility how you going to buy stuff if we end up with price controls which I think may come there's going to be shortages there's going to be black markets how are you going to buy stuff on the black market it may be that silver is what you need so you're not actually going to sell your silver you're going to use it as money and one of the best monetary Silvers is junk silver if you don't know what junk silver is those are US coins minted by the United States that circulated as legal tender up until 1964 all dimes quarters and half dollars were made of silver 90% silver to be exact in 1965 they took the silver out of uh the currency or the coins and they replaced it with nickel and copper but pre1 1965 you get silver and they sell junk silver in bags and they call it junk because it's circulated know you can buy uncirculated uh dimes or quarters or half dollars and they cost more because they're more for collectors if you just want the silver that's in the coins then you buy the junk silver and they sell it by the bag a full bag is ,000 face not a th000 ounces of silver but a th000 uh dollars face and you can buy it in fractions of a bad we're running a special at shift gold over this weekend so you can call don't even wait till Monday you could do it over the weekend we're going to be selling junk silver at $1.79 over spot this is a very low price and in fact looking at the premiums historically junk silver is cheap it's cheaper over spot than it normally is I expect that to change I think the move up in silver is going to attract a lot of demand and there's not a lot of supply of these bags so while there is some you should contact shift gold if you want to get half a dollars and they're you know they're nice looking coins uh you know you get the Kennedy half dollar the Ben Franklin half dollars you can buy those but they're actually 50 cents an ounce extra more than a dime or a quarter the dimes are a pretty good deal because if you want a really small quantity they're perfect for barter and they don't you know they don't cost anymore the reason that the half dollars are more expensive is they didn't mint as many there's not as many half dollars around as there are dimes and quarters so it's all a supply and demand situation plus people like the half dollars just as a solid coin and so you're going to pay more if you want to get them but the key is to get them before the price and the premium go much higher you know every time we get one of these strong Fridays I think maybe over the weekend we're going to get an explosive rally Sunday night come Monday morning we're going to Gap way up we haven't had that happen yet but it's gonna happen and I think when we get a real big move because today's move was solid but it wasn't you know the type of move that I know is coming that may happen Monday it may not it may happen on another Monday or any given day but I think there's a good chance that when gold and silver really break out it's going to be in Asia because that's where all the buying is coming from in fact if you look at the prices that are being paid in China for gold and silver especially silver they're paying big premiums over what we're paying over here so that's where the buying is taking place in fact if you look at investors both in the US and Europe they've been net sellers the ETFs the gold ETFs have had net outflows for the last 11 months now I don't know so far for May maybe it'll change because this month isn't over and we don't have the data but for the prior 11 months investors that buy ETFs have been selling gold the entire time that it's R gold closed the day up $40 it closed at$ 2415 approximately $40 an ounce on the day this is the highest close ever for gold it's the highest weekly close ever because we happen to be at the end of the week it's not the highest price ever because back in April intraday we traded as high as 2,430 we didn't close there we sold off quickly that was about you know early in the morning today we closed higher than we did the day gold set that all-time record high I think that's extremely bullish the charts look phenomenal for Gold Silver and copper also uh platinum and padium have been moving up as well I mean it's the entire Metals complex that has been rising you know recently um jome pal said he doesn't see any evidence of stagflation he sees no stag he sees no flation well he's CLE clearly not looking at Copper not looking at Silver you know silver is an industrial metal but it's also a precious metal copper is more of a industrial metal I think what's happening in silver and copper is even more indicative of inflationary pressures building than what's happening in Gold the big buyers in Gold have been the central banks they're not buying any silver they're not buying any copper this is being driven by inflation and it's not investors who are buying they should be but it this is real buying from the real economy now sure gold is an industrial metal too it's used in industry just not nearly as much as silver because the price is too high so they use silver instead and in some cases silver is too expensive so they use copper but these are very important metals and they are flashing an inflationary warning that the FED is oblivious to the same thing with the weakness in the economy we have been overwhelmed with economic data recently of weakness in the economy and Pal doesn't see that either everybody is delusional in thinking we have this strong economy and inflation is on track to return to 2% we have a weak economy the only thing that's strong is inflation and prices are about to start to rise far more rapidly in the near future then they've been rising in the recent past so the key is before the investment Community wakes up to what's going on you want to buy precious metals and if you look at the action in the mining stocks which I'm very much involved in I have most of my precious metal exposure personally in mining stocks and that's because I'm so bullish on gold and silver that I want to own the companies that not only mine it but that have it in the ground because when you own a Mining stock you own the gold and silver that is in the ground that the mines own that they're going to bring out of the ground in the future when the price is even higher and they're going to sell it and they're going to make a ton of money so I've been so bullish on gold and silver that I've loaded up on mining stocks now over the last 10 years in general buying physical gold has actually been better than buying the mining stocks the reason for that is the entire rally investors have remained skeptical they don't believe it investors expect gold and silver prices to fall and so they don't want to buy uh gold and silver mining stocks because they expect earnings in the future to fall because they think gold and silver prices are going down this is the most unloved precious metals bull market in history which means it's got a long way to go it's not even close a capitulation what we need is the precious metals Bears to capitulate that has to happen we need to see investors who have been shorting gold mining stocks or just avoiding them to buy them because even though the GDX and the gdxj which are indexes of gold and silver mining stocks even though both of those indexes closed at 52 week highs today there are fraction of their all-time highs and the GDX was up a little over 3% today gdxj maybe 4 and a half% those are big moves but they're not nearly big enough considering what's going on considering where the price of gold and silver are right now where they closed and where they're likely to be in the near future institutions are not buying these stocks and what that tells me is prices are going to keep Rising until they do buy gold and silver prices I think are not going to have any meaningful correction that represents any kind of buying opportunity until the price is high enough to cause the Bears to capitulate and we're not even close to that moment we haven't had big short covering we haven't had a big influx of buying we haven't even seen gold and silver stocks get upgraded nobody is putting buys on stock stocks uh that are holds uh nobody is reiterating or raising their price targets everybody on Wall Street is oblivious to what's happening I don't know if they're intentionally not noticing it or they just literally don't notice it because none of these stocks are on anybody's screen nobody even cares about gold and silver maybe they talk about Bitcoin and that's been a big distraction to prevent people with seeing what's happening in real gold because they've been fixated on Fool's Gold well the smart money has been buying physical gold and silver underneath the radar and so I recommend that my clients take advantage again the guys at shift gold are going to work all weekend so that you could buy before the open on Monday now maybe Gold's not going to take off but you know what doesn't matter you got to buy it anyway but who knows something could be going on something big could be happening in Asia and maybe just may while Americans are enjoying their Sunday you're going to see an explosive rally uh overnight they wake up Monday morning and they're going to see much higher prices in gold or silver I'd rather buy mine now and own it than be surprised uh by not buying it and have that happen because even if it doesn't explode on Monday you got it I don't see significant downside from here maybe Silver's never going back below 30 I don't know maybe uh we have support just below there but we're at 3150 what difference does it make again when silver is at $100 an ounce is it going to matter if you bought it at 31 or 29 or 28 or 32 no it's not going to matter what's going to matter is if it's at 100 and you still haven't bought it because you're waiting for a pullback there's no reason to wait just call up uh shift gold uh and they will uh recommend or help you with the junk silver with the special that we have and of course you could buy anything you don't have to buy the junk silver special I just think that it's a great time to do and if you don't have some you should get some and if you have some it's an opportunity to buy more but you can also buy gold you know on this breakout it's a first time ever closing above 2400 eventually $2,400 gold is going to be very cheap and so before it it it is you want to buy it before we get a real expensive price people think the current price of gold is expensive because they don't have perspective they're just looking in the rear viw mirror and they're lot looking ahead at what the prices are likely to be in the future and again if you are more speculative gold is a conservative store of value it's a safe haven if you want to look at the opportunities of mining stocks if you don't want to buy just gold and silver at shift gold but you want to own the mining companies that have the silver and gold in the ground then contact the representatives at europacific asset management or look into the europacific gold fund that could be bought no load at any of the major uh discount brokerage houses that's it for now enjoy your weekend and hopefully you take advantage of our special and worst case you prepared for something that didn't happen immediately but that will happen ultimately but best case you got in just under the wire bye everybody

here not a weigh in on Biden's latest bonehead moves that are hurting our economic recovery even worse Chief Economist Global strategist and founder of shift gold Peter shiff back on the program Peter nice to see you again um I don't know which which bonehead move do you want to start with capital gains tax the biggest increase in 102 years I mean so break that down for folks so so you make a million bucks and in this day and age hate to say this that isn't that much money anymore we used to think it was tons of money and you bought a property and you flipped you bought some stocks and you flip it or whatever now you're going to pay almost 40% the government's going to take almost half of my problem is a lot of capital gains are Phantom gains because they're going to be inflation not even have a gain but you're going to have a tax bill but the worst part about the capital gains tax is that Biden wants to impose a 25% tax on unrealized capital gains which is definitely unconstitutional because it's not an income tax because if you haven't realized the gain you have no income subject to tax under theth Amendment it's a property tax you're taxing property and property taxes are are direct taxes they're still Bound by the rule of of apportionment uh they're not Exempted through the 16th Amendment so it would be unconstitutional but it would also be economically destructive to try to force people to pay taxes on income they haven't even received they'd have to sell their assets imagine having to appraise your illiquid assets every year and then have to pay pay some kind of tax without having the liquidity to actually pay it it would be an economic disaster if if that were to be passed yeah this is insane there's no way this gets through I mean you just said it it's unconstitutional you the government can't take taxes on something I haven't earned what kind of idiot proposes a tax like this and call it an income tax look the states can Levy a property tax because the states are not bound by the the the rule of apportionment of direct taxes but the Federal government can't do that that's why we don't have a federal property tax uh you know believe me if they could get away with it they would but you can't disguise a property tax as an income tax by claiming well we're only going to tax the appreciation of the property it doesn't matter you haven't sold it there's no income so you're taxing the property U but the the other problem with the the corporate tax hike nobody seems to understand corporations don't really pay taxes they collect taxes when you're talking about taxing a corporation you're taxing the shareholders you're taxing the employees and the customers so that's the American public one way or another all corporate taxes are paid by the public so if you're raising the corporate tax you're raising the taxes on their employees their shareholders and their customers that's it yeah and like I said what Corporation if you do that kind of massive hike would want to ever expand or do anything there I mean look that's why they're also trying to raise the exit taxes you know they know people are going to try to leave the country right uh this kind of stuff actually passed now of course it's not going to pass at least you know we've got some Republicans with some sense in in in the house so this this is just red meat to the base right the Socialists that dominate uh the base of the democratic party yeah they want to soak the rich remember the only reason we have an income tax is because the government promised that it was only for the billionaires it was for the carnegies and the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts and it was only 4% when it first started back in 1960 uh so the government lied to the public because as soon as they got the income tax passed they started jacking up the rates and then by the 1940s they they introduced a withholding tax and the next thing you knew everybody was paying the tax so the same thing would happen these taxes that are supposedly for the Millionaires and the billionaires that's just the camel's nose Under the Tent once you allow the nose in the entire camel's coming in it's it's just a pretense Biden is going after the middle class because that's where the money is yeah did you hear that folks and and and Peter is so right I want everybody to think about this because I know a lot of folks out there are struggling and they don't have the income of millionaires trust me I get it folks I'm not a millionaire I don't make a million bucks a year I get it I'm struggling with this economy too so when you're out there and you're feeling really upset and you're pointing the finger at really rich people going yeah they need to pay more pay more you know that there's more of us in the middle class and Peter's right they will put those taxes on us eventually if you keep electing Democrats because there's more of us we will add up to a bigger amount in the coffers than a handful of the 1% million billionaires but people don't get that because they just hear that go yeah tax the rich but we won't get it you will yeah one thing's important though when you tax the rich you're not taking away the money that they would spend on consumption they have plenty of money at to have a good time you're taking away the money that they would have invested in growing economy producing products creating jobs so you actually shoot yourself in the foot it's the middle class and the poor that suffer more when you raise taxes on the rich they just don't realize that yep great Point uh new uh put this headline up guys if you would new poll says 70% of Americans believe the economy is going in the wrong direction let's hope that stays true through November do you think Peter folks are feeling this enough now across this country even in blue states to wake the hell up and say maybe we need to try something different come November yeah you know the public usually gets it wrong but here's an example where they get it right because that's obvious they know how their personal lives are doing they're struggling they're working two or three jobs to get the same income that they used to get from one job yet they can't make ends meet we got numbers today the savings rate collapsed uh down to 3.2% inflation expectations Rose spending went up but not because people are buying more but because they're paying more that's why consumer confidence unexpectedly went down yet again the voters know how bad this economy is because they're living living in it they're not buying Medan the Democrats are trying to sell or even Wall Street everybody is sugarcoating the economy we're in a recession it's actually stagflation we have a weak economy and we have hot strong inflation the worst of Both Worlds yep and and the media and the Biden regime and Democrats keep trying to convince people it's going great the economy's good and thank goodness people are waking the hell up Peter shiff as always thank you sir for coming on appreciate you

central banks globally they've been massively accumulating gold you know gold is completely out of the system it doesn't need anybody to say that it's money and according to the bank for international settlements gold held at home runs no political risk it is the only financial asset that runs no counterparty risk in other words this is not your debt that I have to count on you to pay right it runs no counterparty risk it's a proven inflation hedge over time and you know gold is critical for you to have completely outside of the system because look at this little teeny thing and this is a 1 o gold coin and it's an easy way to carry a lot of wealth in a small little package that truly is outside of the system that I hold and I own outright it's critical gold is the primary currency metal and it's the metal against which they revalue currencies when they do a an overnight reset silver is the secondary monetary metal while both of them are used in manufacturing silver has a lot more manufacturing use gold does not get used up in production in industry it's all recoverable so we can account for about 98% of it all the gold that's ever been mined in thousands of years silver gets used up so you will see silver move toward its fundamental value along with gold but um it's not going to be Wall Street that's telling you what its true value is it's going to be the central banks when they do those overnight revaluations and I would like to say that even when we go into the digital currency the digital dollar people will think oh well then that's going to fix the system but no cuz they're not going to change their behavior what Absolut absolutely 100% has to has to has to happen is that all of the debt that we've accumulated the trillions and trillions and trillions of debt that has been globally accumulated needs to be burned off and that's what the hyperinflation is really about is burning off all of that debt and then it becomes obvious to everybody that the dollars Euros Yen whatever it is that they have absolutely zero value I know this is going to sound crazy but you know a lot of things that are coming to pass now that I said in the past sounded crazy back then oh you can't say that my job is to tell you so that you can make educated choices so what will happen is we'll go into hyperinflation mode and then people will lose complete confidence in the currency in the system and they'll stop using it and they'll go to a barter system so you'll get real local for a while that's where silver really comes into play and you'll go real local and then what will happen is they'll want you to use the currency again so you know like a pack of gum could cost you know $112,000 which I know sounds outrageous but it won't soon right so they'll Lop off zeros and they'll do that overnight revaluation and then you'll see gold like in Venezuela it went up overnight like3 500% something like that and Venezuela has had now three overnight revaluations against gold so they do that to gain the public confidence again but they won't change Behavior yet globally on average it takes them doing it three times before then they go into a system where we actually would have gold to a degree backing the new currency that's when they'll get the confidence back but the Cur the next currency won't be good until there's a component of gold to stabilize it because what gold does is it requires the government to have fiscal responsibility you know they have to live within their means or at least on a relative basis right now there's no restrictions I mean as we've seen as we've witnessed no restrictions on how much new money can be printed but every time that happens the value of what's already out there is lost where it loses more I should say but we're all experiencing a huge amount of inflation right now although it's going to get worse there's not one doubt in my mind I can't guarantee this but you know I'm pretty darn sure that we are at the beginning of a hyperinflationary event and the only difference between inflation and hyperinflation is the speed of that inflation the problem is that there's virtually no purchasing power left in the US dollar if you go on the Federal Reserves website the Fred F and in the search bar you put in purchasing power of the consumer dollar what you'll see is that there's officially Three three cents left out of the original dollars worth of purchasing power which means it's worse than that and all of this infra inflation that we're experiencing we are losing rapidly whatever little bit of purchasing power is left and so the bottom line to all of that is that we are at the end phase the end of this Fiat this government debt-based money and that is one of the patterns is very high inflation you know a lot of people procrastinate because they think they're going to magically know the second before they lose all choice and that's really what my big concern is is that people will postpone and postpone and they'll look at you know the meme stocks going up or the stock market going up and they'll think oh okay look at I can make all of this money there so I'm not going to buy gold I mean what is gold doing yeah it's near its high it's too expensive you know interesting that stocks at a million times earnings are not too expensive but gold that has the broadest base of buyer is it's not gold and silver are the only assets that are severely undervalued because a rising gold price is an indication of a failing currency so if you've got gains and some stuff great take those gains whatever you have you've got to get prepared and you've got to do it now because what is the price of your freedom worth and that's really what's at Jeopardy is your freedom and it may sound crazy but it is simply a repetition of History the Insiders they're getting out but the normal guy he's staying in she's getting in and stop stop and just use the brain that you have and look at things because we are fast running out of time you know you have to look at your personal circumstance and what you have the ability to do don't procrastinate get your gold and silver now get your food secure your water energy barter ability wealth preservation come together in community it's really the only chance that we have to have a more fair system on the other side of this and shelter those are all the things that we need no matter what's going on to have a reasonable standard of living

you know silver crushes inflation in the 1970s silver was up 3700% easily doubling Gold's return of about 1, 1400% which is nothing to Discount that's for sure but you know being the trade of the decade I certainly believe that because I also feel that and this certainly goes hand inand that inflation is is going to be the defining feature of this decade very much like the 70s if you look at what took place in the 70s the inflation was not Rising up to a sort of a sustained high level what happened was it would rise fall somewhat not to the previous low then Rise Again fall again not again to the previous low so we had three large inflationary waves in the SE 1970s and these were in large part caused by central banks that would react to the inflation they saw inflation would raise rates they would back off uh as they saw the economy sort of start to struggle again and that would allow the economy to rise again the inflation would kick back in they'd raise rates again that would slow things down again but each time the wave was a higher wave you know if we if we talk a little bit about the economics of the 1970s there's something very important to point out how in the 1970s a really interesting comparison is that back then the debt to GDP in the US was 35% so that meant you know much much more manageable much lower debt levels allowed the central bank to raise rates because the debt was manageable even at higher rates today debt to GDP is 130% almost four times what it was in the 1970s this is what I call the fed's Dilemma it knows the government's own debt is is huge at about $30 trillion doar having to pay interest on that kind of debt at higher interest rates becomes unmanageable very quickly and it also crushes many sectors things like housing which is very important and all the you know periphery and related jobs in that sense I'm less worried because I feel that the FED has and and other central banks have much less wiggle room in terms of raising rates and to me that means that inflation is that much more likely to get out of hand and that's why you know I saw it as a defining feature of this decade at the margin it's the investment demand for silver that's going to make the big difference and really push silver prices dramatically higher in 2020 there was incredible demand from Silver ETFs that was something like 330 million ounces there's something to remember about this it's interesting how this relates to how inflation uh Works let's just look at that for a second so you know people will say okay well inflation has risen a lot and if it slows well things are not so bad but we have to remember that they are still bad because that has led to higher prices and higher sustained prices unless you get deflation the inflation has C caused higher prices that are now kind of baked in and so what we've seen with the demand side for silver uh especially from ETFs but certainly for physical silver as well but from the ETF specifically is that as the Holdings in ETFs build it's very interesting to see that even if the silver price Falls and can fall dramatically sometimes the Holdings in silver ETFs they barely budge and that's something that I've I've coined silver is sticky money and we've seen that and that's going back at least a decade in fact it goes back to the Inception of the first silver ETF the S which was the original silver ETF back in 2006 that the Holdings have grown uh dramatically and hardly ever Dro and so all it means is that as people buy into silver ETFs they become long-term holders and so it in a sense it's like this silver is quasi permanently taken off the market and so it drains the supply uh in a very steady way I believe that we've started a a new Commodities uh super cycle this was due to come I think that the pandemic and the stimulus that came from the pandemic just sort of accelerated and kicked it into high gear again I I do go into ways that people can manage risk one is position sizing I say that when you buy into a silver investment to buy into it in trashes uh split that up into two or three purchases to again lessen your risk but I think that the volatility is an advantage that uh investors have especially sort of smaller retail investors you know we're not bound like uh money managers are they have larger amounts that they have to move in and out of stocks they have to maintain a certain amount of liquidity they have to buy into stocks that are listed on specific exchanges and uh they have to react to uh liquidations when uh cents come back and say you know I want to liquidate some of my Holdings in your fund we can be a lot more patient as uh individual investors wait for periods of weakness take advantage of that uh look for mispricings you know again we'll go back to that there's volatility investors should take advantage of that volatility they shouldn't let it scare them away from Silver they should make it work for them and there's so much reward from investing in silver as I said you know I talked about the gains that silver produced in the 1970s uh 3700% in the metal itself is a 37 times return if you can get that in the metal in a massive silver bull it's certainly not unrealistic to e expect 10 to 50 and sometimes even in some special cases 100 times or more returns in some silver stocks we've seen that recently with uh some gold stocks that you know have gone from Discovery to massive uh deposits that have been proven out and that's very very early in a bull market so the potential really is huge and uh it's it's not something to be discounted I really feel like given the opportunity and the economic Outlook people really need to have some exposure to Silver even if it's a smallish exposure the the upside is just so big for a small um allocation to to this space don't ignore the the massive opportunity of silver itself both from the physical and even from the much lower risk ETFs mining ETFs and larger producers and royalty companies that it certainly takes uh some conviction to hold these companies and to realize and to maybe assess where we are in the uh in the bull market but it's very rewarding there's no doubt about it uh it's it's definitely something uh investors and I and I believe every investor even if we're talking about someone who's considerably older um really wants to take the the least risk possible I'll say go and buy some silver coin some from your uh the mint of your your own country or you know something that's easily traded or easily recognized and bought wherever you live that's definitely something that you want to own you know silver is both a monetary metal and an industrial medal in fact it was part of money in the US and in Canada until uh the 1960s when it was completely removed from our coinage and so you know uh the world's had a long history with silver as as money but in the last sort of five especially I'd say five to six decades or so Silver's really become an important industrial metal to the point where half of its consumption half of its use every year more than half goes to uh industrial applications and even 10% of all silver goes to um solar power for solar panels so you know with the the Green Revolution the green energy Revolution silver is becoming really more important than ever in electronics in medicine in green energy Automotive all of these certainly are pushing requirements of of silver and uh that all contributes to it being irreplaceable in my mind no doubt about that

to me I focus more on this acceleration this cohesion of countries that have joined together and and are exploring joining this ever growing Union of countries trying to I guess you could say break free from the Western Hemy and really how significant it is becoming a couple of the things that stick out to me really centers around what Saudi Arabia has been doing and I think to only focus on the bricks with out focusing on the movements that Saudi Arabia has really done and accelerated is only focusing on half of the story and I Look to Saudi Arabia really as kind of being the lynchpin of all of the issues surrounding the dollarization and really the dollar hegemony and it's been that way since 1974 where every country on the planet had to own dollars in order to buy oil that was the deal we struck with the Saudi Kingdom and by extension OPEC who has really for almost 50 years exclusively about 90% of all the oil sales across the globe have been in dollars and this has created a synthetic demand for the dollar uh it's a big deal and it really is what in large part has given us or at least to a very large degree the world Reserve status or the Petro status now subsequently we've seen some moves by Saudi Arabia that to me are very alarming the fact that they had joined the Belt Road initiative along with all of the other OPC countries and that's larous infrastructure project in human history big deal right now that represents almost 75% of human population about 50% of Glo Global GDP we talked about how they had applied for the brics membership subsequently they have also applied for the Shanghai cooperation organization the Shanghai Cooper ation organization is the largest regional military and financial organization in the world it represents about 60% of the Eurasian land mass and 40% of global GDP it's very significant in and of itself and with Saudi Arabia joining bricks the Belt Road and now the Shanghai cooperation organization we can see the movement that they are making we can see what's important to them we can see how they are pushing away from the Western influence and getting very close with some very very powerful entities influential entities that are growing more so by the moment they also applied for the bricks new development bank and while in Davos at the meeting they told the world that they would be open to accepting other currencies for oil now when we look at the bricks phenomenon it's a big deal it is I think it's a huge deal now I find this to be interesting if you put together the Belt Road initiative the bricks the Shanghai cooperation organization and the UR Asian economic Union you're damn near close to 85% of human population and this is a growing Trend in motion it is a very very big deal and I guess what they're doing is they're being very methodical in the way that they are laying the groundwork the foundation to when they flip the switch they have laid I think the proper Foundation to do it the right way and so whether or not we see a goldbat currency in a few weeks or in a few months or next year to me the alliance that is being built this Alliance that represents the majority of human population that is not going green is a very big deal and Saudi Arabia only adds to that significance with their movements nestling into these organizations now let let me clarify something all of the entities on the Belt Road initiative are not all part of the bricks they are not all part of the Shanghai cooperation organization or the Eurasian economic Union but you can see that they are all on the same team they are all moving towards the same direction and to me when you realize that all of the OPEC countries are on the Belt Road it even becomes more significant but that group of of countries that are all pulling in the same direction do indeed represent 85% of human population I think what it is it's it's the first chance that these countries have really to break free and they're doing things in a way that is specifically Cooperative mutually Cooperative as an example China has brokered a peace deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia two countries who traditionally have really not liked each other whatsoever in fact they're building embassies in each other's countries they are building the first ever Railway between Iran and Iraq they are going into these countries and they are building China behind most of it is they're building Railways and bridges and Maritime channels they're building oil refineries and and gold mines and they are showing ways for these countries to industrialize and build their middle class have the things that the rest of the world has envied the United States for forever China is going and saying to these countries let us help you industrialize let us help you get to a place that you want to be join together but it's further than that too I mean we now see that Iran is working alongside of Saudi Arabia the United barab Emirates Qatar bin Iraq Pakistan and India in building the brics naval Alliance you know you're talking two of the three largest nuclear arsenals in the world you're talking 15% of all the known gold reserves and really I would argue a whole a lot more than that is they're not very forthright in terms of what they own but you have countries that are building an infrastructure in terms of cooperation in terms of a potential growing of their economies in terms of military arrangements and agreements all of the things are being put into place for them to I guess you could just simply say start start a new system that is free from the Western hemony and I think that's a very big deal to the majority of these countries who look at the weaponizing of the dollar and wonder if they're on the wrong side of the United States and their plans are or the west and what their plans are where roughly 30% of the world's countries are being sanctioned in some way by the G7 these countries I think look at this as an opportunity where strengthen numbers and unity and doing things of mutual Cooperative benefit this is a big deal for all of them but indeed at some point I do believe that they will issue a common settlement currency with the bricks and it will be backed by something why would the bank of international of settlements have reclassified gold as a tier one asset if it wasn't going to be significant and used in some form of stability backing the system why after almost almost 80 years would they have chosen gold and why have all the central banks repatriated the gold and why are the central banks buying more gold over the last 18 months than any time in history and of course the the countries that represent the Ricks in bricks Russia and India and China and South Africa and you can throw in Saudi Arabia they all have been voraciously accumulating gold for the last few years and so look I think it's inevitable it will happen regardless of the push back regardless of the rhetoric I think there's something to be said for not being completely transparent with the rest of the world until all of the pieces are put in place but you don't have to be particularly astute to see the crumbs that are being laid at our feet

so monetary forces on prices is just looking at the monetary side of a transaction right there's two sides to every transaction there's money and there's what you're exchanging for the money so a monetary a monetary effect on on prices would be the money supply expands and therefore prices go up right that's that's simple supply and demand but on the other side you have the the non-monetary forces when the when the money supply goes up that the effect is lowered interest rates and lower interest rates allow more in investment in capital projects and the more Capital you have invested in and extracting Commodities or whatever it is you're going to have a higher supply of those Commodities and that is a non-monetary force from the supply of the non-monetary thing in the in the transaction that's going to the price is going to fall so o over the longer term lower interest rates are paradoxically they're going to lower prices for Commodities because they're going to expand capital investment in the projects to extract more of them but eventually the the higher money supply you know the longer longer term like you know you could say 10 15 years 20 years whatever I know exactly over that term the the money supply is going to catch up and cancel out any productivity gains in uh in the supply of whatever commodity you're digging up from the ground right so you have this war between the monetary and the non-monetary forces and the question is basically when do the monetary forces eventually wipe out all of the supply gains and I think the answer is when the when the money supply has to go past has to expand at a faster and faster Pace much faster than you could ever extract resources from the earth or build stuff with capital uh at a at a certain point the amount of money has to keep climbing climbing faster and faster and faster in an exponential curve if I just looking at this this morning I was looking at turkey and and looking at their money supply and their their exchange rate with the with the the L's exchange rate with the dollar keeps getting worse and worse and worse at a faster and faster rate and then you look at their money supply and it keeps expanding faster and fter you like like turkey why don't you just stop printing money for a second all right and let your currency just like regroup and stop attacking it the answer is they can't because that would lead to that would lead to the collapse of their banking system which is all dependent on more and more and more lerra coming into the system but it's the same with every fiat currency so the the monetary forces are going to Trump the non-monetary forces pretty soon and this is just another way to describe the end game or the hyperinflationary end game or whatever you want to call it it's all the same way different ways to describe the same elephant I think the the British crown is a little bit of a special case I think for two reasons one is that they were they were I think the only one I think the only Western Country or the only developed country that uh during the the the initial phase of the lockdowns they decided to allow their Central Bank to directly Finance the government deficit immediately when this happened I think in March or April 2020 I said looks like the UK is going to be the first to hyperinflation I didn't know when but when you start doing that it's bad it's bad bad news and I I know that not from personal experience but but I I looked into the hyperinflation in Israel in 1984 and that's exactly what happened and for some reason the new shekele just like survived and nobody knows why but I I looked into why the the answer why is because they changed the rules of the central bank and they said the Bank of Israel can no longer directly Finance the deficits of the of the knesset of the government that's now illegal and that was enough confidence instilling to say okay fine we'll give you another shot on this new shck we'll just index it to the dollar and we'll give you a new IPO on on the currency so along with directly financing the debt directly financing the the the bailouts and the lockdown financing and all this the UK also decided to hand out hand everyone hand out everyone like 70% of their paycheck and the UK still has this like hangover vision of itself as the financial Hub of the world which they've hold held over from the 19th century so they think they can do more with the pound than other countries they can they think they can abuse it more than other countries can so they just went totally Hog Wild and now they're suffering and their their government makes less and less sense by the day and I don't think there's a way out of this for the UK I think this is I think we're in the hyperinflationary spile I could be wrong I've been wrong before it's just my feeling I'm not placing any bets on it but that's what I see it's an it's an inevitable process and it is going to happen because there's no other direction that the system can go in I mean theoretically you could just deflate the entire thing and go back to $35 an of gold from 1933 but that that that requires an entire restructuring of the entire economy for the last like 90 years right it was hard enough moving moving gold from 21 to 35 that that that led to it didn't lead to it was part of a Great Depression of it was basically admission that the entire price array the entire price system that we have is wrong now we have to re evaluate all the prices of everything and that was the that was the rep pegging of gold from 21 to 35 and that created huge disruptions in the economy and people that were part of that economy or part of that price array system and so no longer were they making money they lost their jobs okay so that that's what would happen I'm I'm on the same page with Keith weiner on this and it's not a very popular position but I I was having another conversation with with a a Wall Street guy named David W and he's a pure-blooded central Banker it was very it was a it was interesting talking to him because I I knew we weren't going to agree on much and the first thing I pointed out to him was like you know so you worked on Wall Street you made all this money great that's wonderful but if you look at you know the S&P 500 versus gold since 1971 Gold's outperforming so you could have just done nothing and made more money so and then he answers like well so what I mean gold is just a commodity like you're just arbitrarily like pinning stocks versus gold why not stocks versus I don't know Palladium or rodium or whatever and I was but he doesn't understand understand because because gold is money because it still is this is not it's not just like it's not just you know a religious statement there or you know like a mantra that we say it's the truth you know when again when Roosevelt moved gold from 21 to 35 like if if you don't see that gold is money then what's the point of that to make like wedding rings more expensive like what's that going to do for anything you know it's it's it's not it's when gold is like 20,000 or $30,000 an ounce we're not talking about a world where everything is basically normal except it costs a little bit more to buy a wedding ring okay it's it's something a lot different from that it's uh it's it's a world where the money is falling apart so because again I go through I go to this all the time because of the monetary regression principle you can't just create an array of prices out of nothing it is impossible everything always has to be indexed to the past and what is the past ultimately the dollar was it originated as a gold substitute which means it still must be one because if it isn't one then the entire chain from the past to the present falls apart and you have no prices of anything gold moving up and down is really currencies in their latter stages of Life moving up and down because of the nature of Fiat system which is now in in the hyperinflationary stages as you know Daniel Oliver points out you don't have hyperinflation without hyper deflationary scares which is what forces the central bank to issue more and more currency every time because if they don't there's a hyper deflationary crash and that's what forces the the curve vertical that's that's where we are look in other words there's a predetermined course here and you can trace it back to the origin right when the FED when they very the very first time they decided to inject liquidity into the market by buying a bond right then eventually that bond is going to be repaid on the fed's balance sheet and that money is going to come out out of the economy back to the central bank to pay that Bond and then you'll be back to the original money supply but you can't be back to the original money supply because now there's more people that are dependent on that new liquidity that you just printed so the answer is you have to print more liquidity to pay back that original liquidity and then you have all this more new liquidity that you have to issue more liquidity to pay back

the difference between currency and money and I've been pounding the table on this since 2006 currency has to be a medium of exchange a unit of account it's got to be portable durable divisible something called fungible fungible means interchangeability like if you loan me a $20 bill I can pay you back uh a completely different $20 bill or I can give you a 10 of five and five ones you don't care as long as you're paid back any 20 bucks that interchangeability is fungibility but money has to be all of those things plus a store of value and uh if you're paying for something and it costs you twice as much this year as it did last year you are paying with currency not money money can store value over long periods of time currency cannot by its very design store value over long periods of time unless we're going into a deflationary implosion and then it's not a long period of time anyway but it will actually increase in value for a short period of time the difference between what I call Honest money honest money so far is gold and silver these are the only things that throughout history if you look at the last 5,000 years of mediums of exchange the predominant medium of exchange has been gold and silver I've got an old Pegasus coin from 500 BC on my desk and you can melt that down and the silver in it uh has purchasing power now it'll bounce up and down in purchasing power depending on how in favor or out of favor gold and silver are but they never ever go to zero they bounce up and down in this purchasing power range and right now they're very low in that range because we've come up with all these different other forms of paper wealth there's paper dollars there's stocks there's bonds there's just all these different places that you can actually store your purchasing power in uh and then there are these moments in in time where the population gets scared and everybody rushes back to real money as a safe haven and their purchasing power increases astronomically uh in the bull market of the 70s gold went up 25 times its initial price and this was eight and a half years and silver went up 41 times that was actually the biggest bull market in history to that date cryptocurrencies have been bigger but the gold of the70s was the biggest bll Market in history now the difference between currency and money honest money when you make a transaction you're trading something for something it's honest it's fair it's not fraud to create a gold coin there's a whole bunch of time and effort put into prospecting finding a claim turning that claim into a mine mining The Ore refining the ore and pouring it into gold bars and melting those bars and min coins for you to acquire enough coins say to buy a house you put in an equivalent amount of work that at whatever pay scale you're at equals the amount that it took to make that coin otherwise they won't make the coins and then you buy the house and the value of the house the the time and effort it took to dig up the dirt to make the copper for the plumbing and wiring and refine that and the the cement for the foundation and cut the trees and turn them into Timbers to build the house that work equals the work that you put in which equals the work that the minor put in to create the gold so it is a fair transaction of equal values with currency you go into the bank you say owe me something and they imagine this into existence diluting the existing currency Supply and transferring wealth from anybody that's holding currency to this newly invented currency so that's theft and then you're going to buy a house with nothing and you're going to get something for it and that's fraud and so that's the difference between honest money gold and silver and Fiat National currencies if you're in a decade let's say your home doubles in price did it double in value well if you're going to measure it against other real estate absolutely not it didn't go anywhere if you sell it you could buy one about the same in the same neighborhood for the same amount of dollars or whatever you're measuring it with if you're measuring it with money gold and silver or if you're measuring it with barrels of oil or groceries or gasoline if you sell that house and you can buy twice as much groceries and gasoline with it or shares of stock with the the proceeds from selling that house but if over a 10-year period of time let's say the house doubles but the stock market quadruples that means the house doubled in price but its value compared to stocks fell by 50% because when you sell this the house you could only get half the the amount the shares of stock that you could have G gotten if you had just spent the currency even though it was half the amount of currency you would have gotten twice the amount of shares of stock the same thing goes with like if if uh inflation is Raging your house doubles in price and you sell it and all the groceries and gasoline have quadrupled you can only buy half as much so the house dou in price but went down 50% in value while it was doubling in price that's the difference between price and value Asset classes gold silver oil stocks real estate and several other things going back into the 1800s so more than a 100 years worth of data and what what you see is that when you measure stuff with other stuff nothing goes up permanently everything appears to go up in in price they it keeps on going up and up and up I mean a house back in the Great Depression single family medium price home might have been $253,000 now it's $300,000 uh so it's a h hundred times higher than it was then in price the house actually though for the number of work hours it takes to buy that house has actually gone down uh this is the currency changing not the house the house didn't change everything runs in these waves and Cycles one asset class outperforms another one for a certain number of years and then uh one becomes too overvalued the other becomes too undervalued and they switch and get a bull market it's gold and Silver's time basically you know they had that bull market in the 70s and in the middle of that bull market there was a a huge correction a mid cycle this is a secular bull market so it rose up to the end of 74 and then 75 and into mid 76 it pulled back by 50% it Rose to 200 pulled back to3 and then took off and in the next uh just few years it went to 873 actually was the in day high and so uh then it went into a 20-year bare Market well we're in this very very long secular bull that is larger in mag both magnitude and in time than the one in the 70s and we've been in a pullback this midcycle correction now has lasted since 2011 it's getting a little bit boring but this huge shift from other asset classes into gold and silver that started in 2000 and it continues I consider it one big cycle and one of the things that I was determined to do when I started down this road is not to let the bowl Buck me off of back so even through the midcycle correction I've just stuck in there in there and added to my position and I will continue to do so and I have a feeling that over the next just few years one two three years that we're going to see some huge rewards uh especially as we go into the next Crisis and there is a crisis coming because you can't manipulate the economy as much as they have and distorted as much as they have without consequences

and I strongly urge people to listen to what I'm saying and to consider owning gold and silver as significant historical wealth and not rely upon a dollar which is at the end of its really its kenian Fiat experiment why are the super private and well-informed investors draining the London Metals exchange and comx of all its metal to where the London Metals exchange has the least amount of silver ever in the history of the exchange since they started taking records why as 70% of all the registered silver bin drained off of comx over the past 18 months why do we see in one day 45% of all the

when you deliver a bar off the comx exchange it's a one-way street because you no longer have the liquidity but we had some very large orders that some of them have become public because one of the clients that I did an order with wanted me to tell the world how difficult it was for her to get $50 million out of the bank to place an order with us it took her almost 5 days and she wanted me to tell everyone that get your money out of the banks because it took me five days to get my money the threats of calling The Regulators to get my money out of the bank so anyone who pulls metal off a comx like this these massive deliveries we've seen where in one day all this stuff is disappearing and this bleed down of Supply normally they would take it out of one category called register those are the bars that can be delivered and move it into eligible those are bars that they're eligible if if I want to put them into register but they're not for sale they're mine I'm hanging on to them not for sale and that's what a lot of people would do they would just keep them in an eligible category well instead of doing that and leaving them in the safety of an eligible category that means if one of my clients who has a whole bunch of thousand ounce bars wants to sell them and take advantage of Elon musk's generous offer we could transfer them from eligible to registered and Elon could then take possession of them registered means all of the numbers are already validated on the bars the weights the bar numbers the authenticity goes from eligible to register it he can take possession of them pay me my money but not if they're not in the comx ecosystem so when all of this stuff is delivered off of comx it's a big deal where's it all going there was just an article by Reuters and blomberg and it said that the Central Bank bought a record 399 tons of gold uh worth over 20 billion in the third quarter of 2022 uh 340% higher than Q3 2021 almost double the previous record of 241 tons in Q3 2018 but Bloomberg called the buyers of all of this gold and silver mystery whales and they postulated that the mystery whales buyers were likely either China Russia Saudi Arabia India and they also noted that the Central Bank purchases were nearly double the previous record so what do all of these countries have in common yes they're bricks so you are seeing massive draw Downs huge amounts being drawn down off the exchanges and it's a one-way street because once it leaves comx it's lost its liquidity these deliveries these massive draw Downs in metals it's been happening since I started talking about others in 2020 it has not stopped in fact it's increased massively and who's been buying more gold at any time since 1967 oh yeah the central banks why are they buying gold and silver oh yeah Gold's tier one Reserve asset and everyone's moving away from the dollar and you see how all of these things start to come together I think we often take the Dollar's Reserve status for granted simply because we've grown up under this system but the truth is is that Reserve currencies come and go every hundred years or so and the dollar was the only choice when we moved to a full fiat currency system because of Bretton Woods and the trillions of dollars that have all been circulating globally but I think that we are looking at a period of time right now where these countries are beginning to break away and accentuate themselves against the century old centuries old western dominance I think the handwriting is on the wall we will wake up at some point probably sooner than later to to a new system that will challenge the dollar for its World Reserve you already have China saying to Russia that we are ready to get serious right now and build the energy infrastructure with Russia and the other brics nations you can see it it's happening and when that announcement is made and OPEC and Saudi Arabia dump the dollar as a so settlement currency in all of these countries on the planet who have had to own dollars for 50 years start to sell them because the dollar becomes a hot potato this is your great reset moment where the dollar comes flooding home creating massive inflation hyperinflation and the byproduct of inflation is higher interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power I really do believe that if you are not a contrarian you will be a victim I really do believe that if you are fully invested in dollars you're destined to go broke and I want people to know that when I talk about gold and silver it is never ever ever go back and listen anything I've said for the past decade gold is not an investment silver is not an investment May perform like one may make you wealthy but they are wealth 5,000 year wealth that has outlived every World War German hyperinflation the Great Depression and every pandemic and when you see the most well-funded well-informed influential Traders on the planet accumulating the stockpile of metal that they are when you see a company like JP Morgan who paid a $920 million fine to the justice department for suppressing gold and silver accumulate over 45 million ounces of gold and 1.2 billion ounces of silver the largest physical position of medals ever owned off their books when you see that the most sophisticated well-informed influential Traders on the planet massively accumulating metals and d dollariz whether it be the US commercial Banks or the foreign central banks when you see the rise of the others the most influential and well-informed private Traders draining the London Metals exchange draining the comx when you see gold reclassified tier one when you see all of these countries coalescing when you see all the 13 OPEC producing countries on the Belt Road the US isn't part of it when you see 200 countries at the IMF from around the world say we want a new system why did they choose gold as a tier one Reserve asset why not special drawing rights from the IMF all of these things put together in and of themselves okay put them all together and look at it as a sphere and you can see the dollar screwed you can see the West is living on borrowed time when you see all of this stuff together if you don't see the fact that being in dollars fully and exclusively is a very bad idea that you're not looking at the world the way that I am and I think it's just a matter of time before people in this country have a religious experience because when the dollar gets dumped by OPEC which it will uh you can see it you can see the fact they don't even take Biden's phone calls they are joining bricks they're moving away from the West to a a massive majority of human population that is not going green it's helmet and this is why you own gold and silver It Is wealth this is why they're buying it because it's wealth it's not an investment it's wealth and I strongly urge people to listen to what I'm saying and to consider owning gold and silver as significant historical wealth and not rely upon a dollar which is at the end of its really it's kenian Fiat experiment and it's coming to an end and I think it won't a pleasant experience

one of the most pointed moments where I really saw contradiction here was that he said something like the well the fed's job is to set interest rates so I said wait a say hold on So You Believe in price controls and he said no of course I don't believe in price controls but I said isn't isn't the interest rate of price and you want the FED to control it so that's price control he's like no no no that's not what I'm saying well don't don't price controls control the pr like control the prices of goods in the economy it's like yeah well so everything in the economy is affected by interest rates yeah so you believe in price controls of everything no no no no so he couldn't it's not like he objected to that and proved that I was wrong it's like it was like putting like a contradiction algorithm into a computer and it just like kind of glosses over it and like keeps going even many gold bugs and silver stackers do not really understand the point that gold is money we're not making a historical point that in the past it was money and now we have the dollar I'm saying right now all the time when you use a dollar you're using the gold value of a dollar the gold is the money itself but if you look at at the s& versus gold since 1971 gold is outperforming so you could have just done nothing and just held money and you would have made more money the the monetary system is still based on gold because once the gold exchange rate with the dollar or any other currency goes to Infinity that is the definition of hyperinflation and some people are just really incapable of understanding that because it means they've been going in the wrong direction they have to turn around go back and it's going to lead them to disaster and and that's what I'm saying my point is that many gold and silver bugs do not understand that gold and silver are money okay gold is is by definition what a dollar is it's a substitute for the dollar it's at an inflated rate now that doesn't make sense so we're we're buying it now on a huge discount assuming that the substitute collapses and all purchasing power goes back into the original because that's what's going to have to happen to save the division of labor when the substitute collapses and silver and silver by the way is the how I see it is the primary gold substitute when we're on a gold standard silver is the main gold substitute unless there's a functional paper one or digital one that is honest and on a silver standard gold is you know a silver substitute but we're not on a silver standard anymore we're onun a gold standard what I'm saying is that gold and silver do form the basis of all monetary systems it's not it's not an escapable point you can't say we have an option to base it on gold or an option not to there's no option there's only one option that is to base it on gold because that's where all prices originate from in the past and you have to continue that chain you must continue the chain unless you have like a you know a Cambrian Extinction and you really start life up from the beginning and and Humanity goes back to a pure system of B where gold doesn't even exist that's really Armageddon and that's not going to happen okay we're going to have the end of a monetary system it's not going to be the end of the world it's going to be the biggest economic disruption in the history of the human race for sure but it's not going to end us so whatever monetary system we work out also after this huge disruption after the biggest disruption economic disruption monetary disruption in the history of the world there there's not going to be any central body that says okay well we screwed up what are we going to do centrally plan a new system so that it can work now it's not going to work that way you're not going to have the IMF or the WF or the bank of international or whoever these globalists are they're not going to come together and impose a new system on us that works it's not going to be a central plan it's going to be the breakup of the economy like the break up of the Roman Empire and you're going to have pockets of people exchanging things for gold and silver because it's honest or an honest substitute for it and then then gradually after the big explosion breakup collapse of the Roman Empire American Empire same thing then you're going to have a rebuilding of pockets and gradually they're going to connect again it's going to take a while that's what's going to happen in terms of what's going to be planned or what should be planned as the new monetary system how about honesty okay gold and silver are money use that when you when you substitute it don't inflate it and that's going to be the that's going to be the new monetary system just like it is after every collapse of every Empire that's what always happens it's what's going to happen now technology does not change the nature of who we are and we're going to see it again okay so the the second part how do I see it unfolding exactly I I can't see it how it unfolds exactly in terms of the consequences of it I don't know how many people will get rich I don't know exactly what political landscape is going to look like I don't know it's just going to be a lot less centralized it's going to be a lot re more Regional local that kind of thing I know people want a more more you know mey answer than that so I guess I could say look the dollar is eventually going to die in the streets of the US I've said this before the dollar is by definition the other side of the assets on the fed's balance sheet most of those assets are either treasuries or mortgage back Securities I don't see treasuries defaulting outright because because they'll always raise the debt ceiling to enable more more paying back of those things but mortgage back Securities could default because people could theoretically stop paying their mortgages and when those start to default you have what you have is a massive deflation because if one side of the dollar defaults on balance sheet then those dollars go out of existence on the other side because it balances out and then you have a massive deflation and then what happens is the Fed is going to have to print like to to replace those dead dollars and that's when you'll start to see the supermarkets raise prices on bread on the front end right it's connected in a in a very long chain which the end of the chain at the supermarkets cannot see what's happening at the fed's balance sheet it's not like a supermarket you know uh director is going to look at the fed's balance sheet and say well mortgage back SEC defaulted today I guess we have to raise the price of bread by half you know 50% that's not what happens it's a chain that filters through the system and know one part is conscious of another part directly it's just all connected this is not the only way it could happen you start seeing defaults on mortgages and falling housing prices and then uh banking trouble from a bank that owns all these mortgages and then a bailout and the fed's balance cheat and it goes like up like5 trillion in a day and then the dollar starts to collapse in the streets maybe that's one way it could happen it could happen a thousand other ways I don't know if bricks theoretically theoretically the bricks or a bunch of regional powers can group together and say we're going to trade in gold now and either they're going to say like this is the currency that we're going to back with gold whatever that means back with gold if they make it believable and they actually are honest which I I don't think any of them are going to be so theoretically yeah you could have countries that decide they want to trade honestly and with gold either directly actually physically shipping the physical metal I don't think that's is not going to happen or making an actual honest currency fine that would undermine the dollar yeah but it it wouldn't give them any advantage other than actually making their countryes rich in a real capitalist way with freedom so what I think is going to happen is that no brick bricks are not going to come up they they might come up with some kind of way to try to cheat the system and make it look better but that's not going to work um so I see like the entire International trade as it exists today collapsing and and then rebuilding from the bottom up just like I see the collapse of the entire endgame of no Central planning a monetary system no Central planning this just organically happening when the gold steering happened it wasn't like people came like you know these International organizations said okay now we're going to have a gold standard we're going to trade on gold it's just country after country started using gold because other countries are using gold and it worked that's all you don't need these plans these no plan is going to work frankly if there is a raid on the comix and and people actually want the physical metal then it will be a problem and I do see that happening but it has happened before that that I think in 2015 2016 when silver was at a low and you would expect silver to be drained after that but it the supply went back up but then you could say it went back up into the comx because the demand for silver was low back then so if we're at a point where if if what's happening we don't know exactly why the the registered silver is going down yet we can theorize well maybe it's that people want physical silver maybe but I don't I don't know I I even interviewed or asked these people who are taking the actual stuff what they're doing with it I don't know but I want to think that they're taking it to save it because they see a monetary collapse and maybe some of them are and if that is happening then yeah it is significant that when that if these people are taking the supply off for that reason then a low Supply would mean that that that the comics could crash if they if too many redemptions are asked for they don't have I don't know if this going to happen I know eventually it will happen I don't know exactly how but I think it's it's definitely a good sign that that the supply is so low because basic economics if Supply is low price is higher right

this is more of a logical point and I get some flak for this because these news stories of different countries looking to bypass the dollar international trade and gold bugs get really excited and again I don't want to say that it's it's worthless news or that it's not significant in any way it is and I'm not ignoring it but what what is happening logically in in in a perimet monetary structure like we have now is that let's say when China and Brazil make a deal over gas okay we're going to use the Yuan to buy gas instead of dollars so what do they do what they're doing is they're using the Yuan to settle a dollars nominated trade it's a nominal difference uh it's still a dollar deal just settled in Yuan and then what happens to those Yuan they're eventually exchanged for dollars so whoever the yuan is going to can make another dollar deal they this is unavoidable in international trade because the international trade system is based in the dollar because of the perimeter structure that's left over from Bretton Woods right when when Bretton Woods had cont tent and dollarss were redeemable for gold the the idea was the United States could siphon the wealth from other countries they would they would encourage other countries to hold dollars instead of gold and you know their their reasoning was like oh well if you hold gold it could get stolen if Germany invades again or whatever Another World War breaks out remember this is right post World War II and America just saved the world or whatever the narrative was so they're like okay so instead of holding gold hold dollars we'll hold your gold and then we'll redeem it if you have $35 we'll give you an ounce of your gold back so don't worry about it just trust our currency and then Nixon like there was a pyramid there was gold in it and then Nixon hollowed out the gold and left the pyramid structure so in the pyamid structure that's empty and Hollow now the dollar is still the base of it so there's no escaping that the only way that a country can truly get around the dollar is not by going above it in the layer in the perimeter layer that doesn't make sense because the upper layers of the perimeter supported by the lower layers by definition or else they'd be floating in the air and they just fall over so the only way you can go beyond the dollar is to get underneath the dollar not above it and the only thing that's underneath the dollar is gold and silver so if you have two countries that are trading Goods denominated in gold and silver in ounces they're not making a dollar deal they're not saying like I'm going to buy $100 million of AD gas for you in denominated in Gold that would still be a dollar trade even with gold what they would have to say is I'm buying 100 ounces worth of gas from you country B that would be getting around the dollar and they're never going to do that until they have to until the dollar collapses they're not going to do that and when will the dollar collapse when it's attacked at home by the Americans in the street and therefore from that core they will not be able to do any more Dollar Deals because nobody will want them so it it's always tempting to build a story about shorter medium-term movements in gold and say well this happen so therefore why happened and sometimes it's true right but it's more often not true so it could it could be that people are looking for a safe haven so they escaped dollars and went to Gold I don't know why gold is moving exactly why it's moving now I just know that inevitably it's going to head there it's going to head up and up and up because that's that's history now the question is so why am I so focused now and saying that and and saying that it's going to head to you know 50% backing of the of the dollar 100% backing of the dollar which would be like 50 $60,000 an ounce eventually why am I saying that now well because you have these like massive gargantuan piles of money in different Pockets everywhere and it feels to me that one more financial crisis the fed's going to have to print like 102 trillion dollars just to touch the exponential curve of of the debt pyramid right it has to go in an exponential curve because the more people that are in debt the more the more debt they need to raise in order to stay in business and to stay servicing their debt cost so it it's an exponential curve that just feeds itself and we're already going vertical so it seems to be that one more crisis is going to do it exactly when this is going to be triggered I don't know but it seems like you know first parts of it already have been and we're just waiting for like a big flood or the you know the big bulk of it to like reveal itself and that could happen anytime now so get ready and don't worry about short-term movements right now it's not important that's the that should be the point we're headed back up in consumer prices and we're headed back up into an environment where the fed's going to have to cut to zero in order to save a bunch of banks so if you have that that combination where the FED has to cut to zero and restart QE in an environment where consumer prices are already Rising furiously you're going to be in an environment where it's going to click and and and the public is going to start to recognize that this is never going to end and they've got to get out of dollars or lose all of their savings and some you know the smart the smart people are going into gold and silver now the people that are not aware of this because most people are not they're just going to buy whatever they can get their hands on when when they realize that they need to and that'll be whatever they can find first gold silver food Furniture whatever that that's the hyperinflationary point so that's what I see next and when it happens I think it's going to happen very quickly and I think we're very close fortunately or unfortunately depends how you look at it I see it as fortunately because I want this to end and I see it as inevitable and just just let's get it over with already already and peel off the Band-Aid and uh unfortunately for those who have no idea what's going on and they'll only find out at the last second there's still a lot of extra money out there that funds and and hedge funds and whoever manages money the big players that really move prices they got to put it somewhere so they're putting it where their algorithms say to put it and uh there's still a whole bunch of Hangover money from the the lockdown printing era and it's got to go somewhere so that's where it's going I mean I I don't really subscribe to the view that the stock market and the economic news are related in any tight correlative way eventually economic news is going to push stocks down because people are going to realize that you know everything is falling apart and and you know stocks are even if they're going up in value they're going down because inflation is going faster and they've got to go into real assets and that's going to happen all at once so this is this looks to me like the extra sideline money is just being sucked in and we should stop paying attention to like these short-term waves and Trends and you know things will go up and down until they fall and that's where we're going let's put it this way but the gold and silver people I'll just tell my story like how how I came to it like there were certain things that made me very uncomfortable with how the economic system supposedly worked that you know I kind of like said I don't like that and I tucked it away and I said I'll solve it later because I don't really know now so I tell this story a lot when I found a thousand shekele bill in My Father's Office drawer now I knew what a shekele was it was like about three shekels to a dollar at the time I found it I'm like like you have a th000 shekels in your drawer he's like oh no that's the old shekele it hyperinflated to zero and now it's worthless so I'm like money always inflates and prices are always going higher he's like yeah but that's how an economy grows I'm like what this you just said it died but now it it's growing what I didn't get it I was like okay whatever I don't understand I'm I'm like a little kid and then the second thing I never I didn't get was like in economics class in high school they were talking about how the dollar used to be gold and but now it's just Fiat and I was like what's Fiat she's like well it just has value because the government says it does I'm like well what if people don't believe the government like how does that sustain a it was like what I was like okay I'll just put that on the test like okay FIA means government say but like what is this and then so when you see that the other problems and then you go back to the foundation you find out that it's empty it's like okay you got to go in the other direction and fill it with some content that isn't part of this system because the whole base of it is emptiness literally we we all have a gut feeling deep in our souls that fake money is is bad and real money is good

tangible assets move through a cycle from undervaluation to Fair valuation to overvaluation to Fair valuation to undervaluation and it's constantly now you cannot say the same thing about Fiat currencies so government debt-based currencies those can and do historically go to zero but a good tangible asset particularly good money gold good money silver these are real tangible assets that are used across the entire every single sector in the global economy uses gold and silver even in food in the financial system in electronics in medicine and on and on and on jewelry every single sector and therefore you have the broadest base of functionality because it it works in every single sector that's the function and therefore you have the broadest base of buyer so 100% of the time you have demand sometimes more sometimes less and in a true Supply demand economy that's what has an impact on the price where the visible price that you see in the economy that we're in right now which is completely financialized which means that everything has been turn real estate everything has simply been turned into a trading a financial trading asset by building those contracts those derivative contracts on top of them they've turned it all into a financial asset you can sell your house like this you can buy your house like that that's not really the way a stable asset really works that's just the way Wall Street works and what we're seeing now is a complete unraveling and what's really interesting and this is something that I've been thinking you know a lot about as I'm doing my work you know I remember in the 80s when I was a new stock broker and all the talk was about globalization and I remember thinking to myself I'm not so sure this is such a great idea and we shipped all the manufacturing most of it overseas right well now we see the result of that and we are in a phase that is De globalization but I really actually think when I look at the coordinated efforts of the central banks well they want you to perceive that there's still a difference between the central bank or the central bank is independent of the government but in this next Crisis because this is so globalized I mean it's it's not just in the financial system it's like in in many sectors of the entire global economy they're talking about eliminating that separation because the central banks are out of tools so that's just mad money printing for governments that want to spend like crazy and when you look at what's happening right now in the US between J pal and the central banks fighting the inflation that they created by raising rates even though they admit that they have no control over the inflation caused by supply chain and the war between Russia and Ukraine at the same time that you have the FED share pal raising rates to increase unemployment so that they can get price stability workers won't ask for more money when they were and there's also if you look on the Federal Reserve education department Fred fed uh the purchasing power that's how much your your money will actually buy you well it's it's still at three cents but we know that we jug juggle these numbers so what I'm really saying to you is the game is over because the only thing now and this is what negative interest rates actually did they've already gotten inflated away your purchasing power now they have to attack your principal so when you know that the game is over this is a Kong game and every and everybody's about to realize it through loss of confidence in hyperinflation well what do you do if you create and looking back at those historic patterns when we've had a currency regime shift they create so much chaos that's going around that you're looking over here you're looking over here you're looking up there and they're changing everything underneath your feet over here and you don't even realize it and it's funny because it's usually all the same kind of issues right so back in the 70s we had the women's movement we have that now we had the oil embargo we have the energy issues now we had civil rights well we've had those issues now we've had high inflation we have those issues now War that's a big one we have those issues now so there's all of this chaos and it's about distraction and it's about creating a big enough crisis that scares the crap out of you so that when they come in with their solution you say save me Mr Bill save me you just accept it in this next Crisis instead of mailing out stimulus checks they just push a button and everybody's got an account and here's this free money well as we saw on the big test that they ran with the pandemic right what do people do with that money they spend it whether they need that money to live on or it's extra money for them read meme stocks read trade all of this you know that's what they do they spend it so when I say that they have this planned we are entering a period where I mean I don't know how many black swans might descend on us at one time these are things that you don't no you can't say well what black swans do you see but a Black Swan event is an event that happens that nobody could anticipate so I can't tell you what that could be but the system is super fragile and it's stretched really it's like a house of cards and any little breath could push this whole house of cards over and while the central banks have done studies on the interconnected nature of the financial system so if it happens in China or it happens anywhere in the world it can travel throughout the entire Global Financial system this new report where they studied Imports exports Investments like a whole bunch of different sectors in the global economy and found them all to be extremely interconnected which is part of why I say this could be a plan because this is a global issue the events have been globally synchronized particularly since 2008 so when you have a decoupling of that synchronization between government and central banks suddenly after all this time especially when they were working hand inand it has to make you wonder but did they suddenly stop talking to each other I don't think so

I've honored my promise to my dad and I buy something every two weeks I have for 33 years I have never not once missed a two-e period ever where I didn't accumulate some gold or silver when we got paid and to me I have always looked at it as wealth it's not an investment to me and it's it's wealth that has outlived two world wars German hyperinflation the Great Depression every pandemic anything the world has ever thrown at it frankly which leads us to today where over the last 18 months the central banks the most well-funded and well informed Traders on the planet have bought more than they ever have in history and so they find it to be significant but what opened up my eyes is an event that happened in 2019 and it really started opening my eyes in 2017 and in all of the public speaking I was doing I would talk about what started to happen in 2017 in 2017 we had witnessed 6 years of a downd drafting Market where the price of gold and silver from its high $1,915 in gold and just about 50 bucks in silver in 2011 from that point forward for the next six years it drafted downwards and by 2017 I wanted to hide under my desk but just not come into the office because For the first time in my career everyone was selling what was typically one out of a 100 transactions was now 65% of everyone's business in this industry where people selling aggravated that gold didn't live up to its reputation as a cut from the same cloth as Bitcoin as Bitcoin soared to the heavens and the the stock market having no gravitational pull continued to move higher and people capitulated yet in 20 uh 2017 something very interesting happened as all of this anti-gold rhetoric was was fluttering Around The Ether the German bundis Bank who had tried for 3 years to get a gold back made a very public disclosure demanding that the FED send it back its gold now I this caught my attention why is the bundas bank repatriating their gold when all central banks have been selling gold the last several years and what really caught my eye is that within a few months of that happening the bank of Austria Poland Hungary the Czech National Bank the Dutch National Bank all of these Eastern European Banks did the same thing they requested their gold back from the New York fed and the bank of England and they made it fairly public the following year in 2018 those same Banks bought more gold as a group than they did in the 60 years previously combined I'm talking about this all over the place uh it was 2019 when I started doing YouTubes and it was because here after this massive acquisition and repatriation by the most well-informed Traders on the planet they doubled that amount in 2019 and out of nowhere I'm sure there was no coincidence in this the bank of international settlements which is the central bank or Central Bank the the most influential Bank on the planet reclassify gold as the world's only other tier one Reserve asset in essence and so since the end of World War II there's been one tier one US Dollars and treasuries gold was always a tier three asset where only 50% was calculated on the balance sheet which would denigrate your balance sheet would inhibit the ability to do things with a full balance sheet here only 50% was was calculated on the balance sheet and and so Central Bankers you know they didn't want to own it it it was denigrating their balance sheet it cost money to store it earned no interest so they would sell it in favor of treasuries or in favor of equities or whatever was doing better and all of a sudden now it's a tier one and the banks had been buying it for the last 2 and a half years before this and repatriating it now something's going on and so there's only one other tier one asset according to the the most influential Traders on the planet other than us dollarss and treasuries and that is gold and when you look at gold that has been acquired by the Banks pretty much non-stop since 2017 there's no coincidence to me that last year or the last 15 months they've bought more than at any time in history this to me is the underlining why is that gold is wealth gold is money and gold is viewed that way by the most influential players on the planet they use the Western suppression of comx in order to run cover for their acquisition if I want to buy a comx contract which is 100 ounces to hedge my position in my in my warehouse I only need $7,000 or thereabouts in my margin account and I control nearly 200,000 worth of gold if I am a commercial bank or a central bank with 500 million in my margin account I control 15 billion worth of gold on comx I can create any perception of reality I want and that is exactly what has happened for a very long time there's a term in economics called Gibson's Paradox which which speaks to the inverse relationship between real interest rates which have been horrible and the price of gold and if you are going to maintain super low manipulated interest rates to create a perception or an illusion of prosperity that we did for so long then you have to step on the canary in the Min shaft and that was the price of gold and yet all of a sudden the most influential well-funded banks on the planet are not only buying it at levels they had never we had never seen before but they were repatriating it from the exchanges and the Western central banks so to me on a very very very basic level that's why people need to own it because the most influential well-funded well-informed Traders on the globe say one thing and are doing the other and accumulating it as if it is really important so on a very generic basic level the biggest money in the world says you should Own It by their actions less by their words and they're using manipulated price to run cover for their dollarization and their acquisition that's why you need to own if the paper Market still is the tail wagging the dog no question about it but I could argue it's losing its ability to continue to do this at a rapid Pace the London Metals exchange is a good example they have pretty darn close to the lowest amount of silver in the exchange that they've had in the 140e history of the exchange we've seen a massive bleed down in Golden silver off the comx market where in 2020 this group of of they're called the others on the comx they came out of nowhere in 2020 there used to only be two groups of reportables on what they call the commitment of Traders report every week The Exchange publishes the positioning of the largest Traders and it was always just the commercial Banks and the specs which would be the hedge funds that's it and then out of nowhere in 2020 they published a new group of reportables they call the others I believe they are sovereign wealthy funds and very well-to-do family offices who are draining the exchanges along with the central banks to the point where in one year in 2020 we saw more silver delivered than in a decade before combined they took more gold off in 2020 than than the bank of Japan has in their official Holdings and these Trends both in what's called exchange for physical where you can buy a comx contract and exchange it for physical in London and or the bleeding down of the Comets is to the point where you're at the second lowest level of silver in the register category in the history of the comx and massive bleed Downs in Gold to in a market that was never designed to be a delivery mechanism this is why it's getting harder to suppress the price because when the price gets suppressed you have Sovereign Nations and Sovereign wealth funds that are standing there like okay we'll take delivery and so the delivery or the prospect of massive delivery off of the exchanges in an environment where the availability of metal is decreasing on these exchanges means we're getting closer and closer and closer to that moment look it's easy for these players to to manipulate a market by pushing it in the direction that it is going when nobody wanted gold and silver it was easy to suppress the price of gold now it becomes a very dangerous game

is I think what's really going on this major asset managers hedge fund managers mutual fund managers who've been around a while have some experience and haven't forgotten the last 10 20 years you know gotten all gleeful because of the stock market they're somewhat suspicious of what they see in the stock market there's all kinds of valuations that just don't make sense the longevity of the market doesn't make sense uh the steepness the recent steepness scares them because it's blowoff type action and blow-offs end very badly the other way so I think there's some smart money out there that's saying hey you know I'm not going to get out of the stock market but I'm going to shift some money out 5% here 5% there and I think what they're doing is it's moving into those asset categories safety of t- bonds and gold and silver I think that's why those two markets are moving in sync right now don't expect it to continue but ultimately yes the t- bonds will go down and price up in yields because if inflation persists which we think it will then you will suffer if you're along the t- bonds I frankly think we're topping right now and I have been thinking that we're in a topping process for several months now that doesn't mean it can't go up I mean you're up until you're down right you know Joe Granville said that but we have numbers below the markets both on the NASDAQ 100 which is our leader index there's no question it's been the leader it's outperformed everything you know the top five six stocks in NASDAQ 100 constitute over 50% % of its waiting we all know the symbols Amazon Apple Microsoft Google Etc they also constitute probably about 25% of the waiting of the S&P 500 so as these indexes have moved up it's not because of the you know all the symbols within the index it it's primarily because of the leadership has been so strong and therefore focus on the NASDAQ 100 because that's where the leadership is really weighted we see numbers below the S&P and below the NASDAQ 100 that aren't that far down there now considering that we've had a dozen year uptrend which is highly unusual and a lot of that's been vertical it's scary and it's scary because if you're a price guy and you're looking at let's say a weekly or monthly price chart of the S&P or the NASDAQ 100 you look at your screen try to Define where you think it breaks try to draw a trend line it's almost impossible you might draw one and then it goes up at a steeper angle you have to draw it again at a steeper you know it's like multiple lines so there's no line that touches three points it's just a curve the problem for the price chart technician that this point in time is when you turn down they really there's no consensus as to where oops it broke something and when you don't have a sense of you know where you are on the map motions can take over Panic can ensue so it's going to be an interesting game this year and there was a lot of stuff's going to happen this year not just the beginning of stuff but actually the culmin of many of these turns we try to put blinders on I mentioned that I saw the front page of the journal today but I don't try to pay attention to what other people think or what other factors might be in play here there are major factors in play Big fundamentals in play we all know that in our last weekend report we had a Fed fund rate chart going back like 30 years I mean you just look at the silly thing and you say no wonder the stock market's gone vertical for a dozen years so zero you know and for 10 12 years no wonder the stock market was inflated we've had inflation for put the you know many years it just didn't go into Commodities until when asset managers again did what change their preferences from stocks to undervalued Commodities that have less risk probably more reward and sure enough that's what's happening so now we have what the public in the FED call inflation in fact we've had it all along it's just been expressed elsewhere in a vertical stock market so I think that bubble's going to burst not that the flow of money from the fed or ECB or the boj is going to stop it's just going to go elsewhere because people aren't going to put it where the FED would like them to put it now what's the Central Bank going to do when the debt markets they must defend are breaking down are they going to taper they going to raise rates yeah I think not and I think gold knows this you know basically the central banks of the West are caught in a historical dilemma of their own creation and they're going down the swirly along with their policies and I think they're going down the swirly this year where will money want to go and you know it's been said cash is trash major asset fund manager said that some months ago and he's dead right and he's not even the goal book so I think the public is getting aware of this and then we come to another interesting issue that's been debated on a lot of the financial channels lately in fact I saw something today on it Bitcoin or gold well we measure them both but we've been watching the spread relationship between the cryptos especially Bitcoin and gold andit coin and silver because our our bets on Silver we think silver is going to vastly outperform Gold Silver's going to leave gold behind on a percentage basis but that spread is measurable meaning the spread relationship the valuation of Bitcoin versus silver well clearly over the last since bitcoin's been around you know it's a baby it's only been around half dozen years or more it's thrashing people can't quite put a valuation on it but it's but it has definitely beat gold and silver in an irregular manner but in a upside very violent just like its price has been those charts to us look vulnerable words it looks like we could be nearing a point where Bitcoin on a valuation basis relative basis could top out versus gold and silver and then they could replace it as the place where people are putting their money for safety reasons uh and it wouldn't surprise us to the effect that okay the shift has occurred it's time now to shift out of Bitcoin and into gold and or silver preferably silver now that doesn't mean bitcoin's got to go down it just means that Bitcoin will will shift relative performance such that silver will beat it going forward and I think that's about to happen ultimately this time I don't think there's a way out and by that I mean you're not going to end with policy working or a vulker comes in and ends it you know and just puts the brakes on and and and stops the process course then you you went down you know we all know that once that happened uh stock market was a wasteland for well from about 1977 through 1982 at least while gold was golden Commodities outperformed it but this time I think it's more meaning I think at the end of this next Crisis and I think we're headed for one not just in pricing but in in that you're going to have people rais the question you know it's been 50 years of this stuff since that Republican Nixon took us off the gold standard you know International Exchange basis of the dollar and we've had nothing but Fiat currencies in Europe here and Japan since then and hasn't worked and we think we've been under control had a policy and all this nonsense and it's just been a boom bust cycle getting worse and worse each time and it wouldn't shock me what a world this is to say this that the ex-communist countries in the world have gold that currencies before we do and set set the the new trend uh and I think that's likely to happen where we end up with stable currencies uh it could be crypto you know crypto at least can't be hyperinflated you know it can be expanded somewhat year to years they they find more you know Etc but it it can't be you know doubled money supply every year like the central bank s can do so it's going to be an interesting year and I think the markets are going to create what I call a swirly and that swirly will affect not just markets but people it's hard to predict these things but I think the trend is pretty evident and we know that the wave effects will create all kinds of unusual outcomes that a lot of people can't it's not on the tip of their tongue right now political events social social events and so forth that perceived to be traumatic but actually will be healing because if you get rid of something bad and it it makes some noise while you're getting rid of it that's that's the way it works sometimes

hey everyone I'm Jeremy saffr this is Kiko news don't forget to hit that subscribe button for the latest now this year the gold market has been on a remarkable ride gold prices have hit record highs driven by robust demand in significant purchases by central banks now in the first quarter of 2024 gold demand sword marking the strongest start to a year since 2016 central banks have been particularly active using gold to diversify their reserves of course this reflecting economic uncertainties and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties as well recent economic data also plays a crucial role here April's headline CPI Rose just 3% month over Monon which was lower than expected this of course boosting investors confidence now the key question now is whether interest rates will remain high for longer or if we'll start to see a rate cut soon lower rate Cuts reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold as gold does not yield interest this making it more attractive to investors and additional a weakened US dollar with the dxy index dropping below 105 has further supported gold prices when the dollar weekend gold becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies increasing demand and then we look over to the Emerging Markets especially bricks countries and they've also been increasing their gold Reserve signaling a strategic shift to diversify away from Fiat currencies and hedge against global economic instability now today we're thrilled to have Joe cavaton he's the market strategist for the Americas at the world gold Council and he joins us in studio here in Vancouver Joe welcome to the show thanks for being in here man great to be here I I appreciate this I'm excited because there's so much to get to let's first start with why you're in town I mean you got beautiful weather on the west coast finally coming from the cim the Canadian Institute of mining conference correct that's right that's right I have an opportunity to speak at the at the event this week here in Vancouver aside from the wonderful weather the the events been fantastic I had an opportunity to w the floor see all the different displays of some of the traditional Technologies but even some of the newer technologies that the mining industry is talking about and then feature on a panel with some really Dynamic people and uh present some of the things that the world gold council is doing including our gold bar Integrity program which is kind of bringing technology and the industry forward in that regard so really exciting conference well attended and happy to be out here yeah I'm excited I mean there's so much to get into there uh I want to stick to Gold but before we do I'm just curious on the mining side is there any Technologies that maybe you saw that got you really really excited here there's two I think that I want to highlight the first is one that we're involved in and that's actually using technology blockchain technology to track and Trace gold from its source through the entire supply chain all the way out to the consumption side now the lbma and the world gold Council are working on Gold Bar Integrity as a program and we've both committed to working with exadrus which is a platform that's going to bring mining companies many of our members have signed to put their gold onto it but also all aspects of that industry onto a tracking and tracing technology so really cool technology that's going to help blockchain at the consumption level be more efficient when it comes to understanding gold and then the second is really a lot of Technology that's around being smart about where they're targeting the digging and and and sourcing mine right sites and and using that kind of that this the ability to to kind of say say this is the track of land that we need to get into and this is where we should be digging so being more efficient around where they're digging so lots of different Technologies but those are two that are really worth highlighting interesting you know it's always interesting for gold bugs because when we talk about the digitization of gold you have some in the corner of excitement right we're going to mature the industry and then you have others that go wait I don't want anyone to know that I have gold so how do you bridge the two in this industry it's pretty simple stuff and I think where we're spending a lot of the energy rightfully so is around tracking and tracing I've used that expression a couple times but I can't use it enough in order for Access and efficiency at that access level to work you need to know what you're getting your hands on and that you're getting it at a fair and reasonable price and that you can trust it so when it comes to ESG standards when it comes to movement of the gold all of these things are enhanced by a a clean carefully crafted and efficient database simply simplifying the ownership of gold at the source and then ultimately it gets into the world of how and when do you use use modern Technologies to give better access and there in the permissioned or the permissionless environments we can have a debate on exactly what's the best way to get to gold but this basic database will allow us to move the gold through the system know where it's coming from know the standards applied to it and then ultimately get it into a world where you can now package it differently right whether it's known telling people you own it or actually not telling people that you own it or however you want to deal with it but it'll make these efficiencies come to life and it's really an exciting opportunity yeah that's fascinating okay let's let's talk a little bit about the gold market I mean what a year I mean we've seen as I mentioned off the top we've seen record highs we've seen central banks demand through the roof talk to me a little bit about these emerging Trends what you're seeing why we're here what got us here give us a lay the L so we've had a couple of good years so from a demand perspective we have 22 and 23 being record setting years for gold demand first quarter again very very strong first quarter demand and a lot of what's happening is the consumption of gold in all the different areas that we regularly talk about are really shining and that use case is coming to life you highlighted central banks the case for central banks diversifying your reserve portfolio adding an allocation of gold increasing those allocations 14-year Trend and really picked up over the last five particularly in the Emerging Markets which I think we'll talk about but secondly the really interesting Dynamic shift that's played out is kind of a pause by Western investors and the Eastern investment taking off so when you think about a market like China where the central bank has been an active and the largest buyer of gold it's also the consumer that's actually been moving not only from jewelry but into investment gold so we've see increases in physical gold withdrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange we see increases in uses of the exchange traded fund products and overall demand increasing there that'll probably slow a bit right but ultimately you're looking at an economic envir on Shore in China that's going to continue to strengthen the case there throughout the rest of Asia and in the East what we see are bar and coin demand levels still continuing to be very strong so again this Dynamic of their homegrown economic situation causing for them to look at diversifiers into their own investment portfolios really working to bring gold into the into The Fray and then again on the western investor side a pause a pause around holding my allocations but not increasing just yet right okay let's talk a little bit about that because obviously US dollar is weakening we're seeing gold demand go up but is it really a East versus West kind of a story here I mean the West has paused because obviously we have meme STS all these trendy things that people can get involved in but when it comes to the actual economic figures are we seeing China mask anything here I mean they're not saying to their people go pick up gold but that's what's happening so what's the telling picture here the telling picture is that the driving factors that everybody wants to think are the only thing that move gold aren't so if you think just about the dollar or just about us rates or those two together it is a driving Factor we drive this point home a lot you have to understand the global consumption and the localization of some of the demand trends that are playing out in particular that need for investor diversification in the East and now it's not only just China it's India it's the rest of Southeast Asia it's turkey but basically in the west the driving Factor for investor sentiment towards gold has been twofold number one it will be D rate driven in the US and the strength or weakness of the dollar but it's also a bit speculative they're trying to get ahead of that move so we might see some flows change and some push on the price but then that quickly adjusts when we hear from the fed and from pal around that timeline to see that Catalyst for when investor dollars will go back right you mentioned exciting stocks around risk assets even lower risk type Investments higher sustained rates more money on Savings in your money fund these are usually impediments to people allocating more to Gold because you can get certainty around what your cash can earn for you even with a weakening dollar they're getting five six% on cash deposits so that's holding them away from gold on the more strategic allocation side but again I think what's interesting if you look at the ETF Market the actual value of the ETF Holdings has increased with the price increase the overall tonnage has been outflows and that's what we've been seeing in terms of units redeemed but think about what's happening to an Investor's portfolio with the increase of price you're still seeing a pretty level allocation as part of their overall portfolio holding they're so they're holding they're not dumping it in mess and by the way the last point to really highlight here even with the West somewhat paused on an holding and gold it's not moving the price negative it's actually not having an impact on the price we're seeing the East Drive the price more interesting okay well I mean obviously you have a lot of insight into this sitting in a boardroom at the world gold camp so you're looking to the Future you're trying to analyze what's going to take place what are some of these Trends I mean talk to me about bricks talk to me about the fact that these central banks are wanting to get away from the US Fiat dollar and they want to start to have some skin in the game somewhere else that they feel is more secure did that start with Russia where did that start and and where are we going that's a 14-year Trend yeah exactly that's a 14-year Trend but I think what's played out over the last four to five has been a real emergence of Central Bank in the developing economies and the Emerging Markets so what you're seeing there is a perspective on the significance of US dollar US dollar assets the Euro and no real Euro Assets in those portfolios and a need for these central banks to find that efficient liquid shock absorber in their portfolio against risks that come withh holding those assets that plus their own homegrown challenges around their economies China as an example turkey as as an example where you can see factors at play whether they're you know real investment driven issues around China or you know systemic moments like an election outcome in Turkey where the Central Bank knows it needs to have that goal to hand and I think that that's actually been a big driver of their behavior but then lastly if you look at the election year in the US and the potential for outcome the local Politics the local election the playbooks that we've seen from both candidates potential candidates I should say is they're they're looking like it's going to be a challenging environment for the US to to tackle down a lot of its fiscal issues so it's level of debt its ability to sustain the debt levels and I think that that's playing into the minds of these Central Bankers so you know we're at the cusp of about releasing our our our annual survey there's a lot more to come on the back of that but over the last several years what we have heard from them consistently has been a less of a Reliance on the dollar less of a Reliance on the Euro not because of geopolitical event risks like what's happened with Russia and Ukraine that's added surely to their decision but ultimately it's just a less of a Reliance and there's a good diversification benefit that comes from gold particularly around its liquidity they access it in the physical Market they're part of what's going on in that OTC flow that you see in our numbers right okay talk to me about the politics behind it I mean you know we start to look into the United States going through an election we start to look at their economy today we saw CPI numbers come in a little bit cooler than expected meaning or at least hinting that possible rate cuts are on the horizon at some point but how much of these economic data points are you looking at when you're looking at the gold market are you even paying attention to this or is it all pages out the window it doesn't even make sense anymore I think it does pay that does make sense to pay attention to it but I I I can't emphasize enough that gold is a global asset and the global factors that will drive its consumption and Its Behavior around the world matter more than just one individual component you have to understand that so we keep an eye on the rates in the US and we keep an eye on the fed and the numbers but like everybody our crystal ball is not giving us an answer yeah and we're not going to wait for it we understand and watch the other aspects and give people that data to make a better and educated decision on it if you were waiting for a rate cut to see the price of gold move then you would have missed a transaction you would have missed the trade right and I think at this stage it's an important element but it isn't going to be the only element that's going to continue to move the price of gold and I think more importantly you know we we talked earlier about the fact that it's not going to be the only element that will keep the price of gold where it is I think that these sustained sources of demand from other parts of the globe are keeping us at higher levels on average first quarter 2070 was the average price we saw over first quarter that was a record high for gold on average over a quarter now we're trending towards 23 2400 but that level's been higher and we're higher to stay for a while because the case for central banks the case for Eastern investors still very strong might slow again we'll have some seasonality to it all um jewelry another area where we're going to see big demand but it'll also slow with higher prices until people settle in on those but again I think that if you think about that back to your original question on politics in the US you know it may have an impact but I think it's going to have more of an impact outside of the US because you're going to look at whether or not the us is going to be able to handle its fiscal challenges right um shortterm we've done a lot of analysis around the impact of an election outcome on gold shortterm it might have impact for bar coin demand but it doesn't have much of an impact on price it's overtime when election outcome leads to policy shift that it'll over time impact policy and then foreign policy and that's where you'll start to see the demand kick in on the back of an election outcome okay so how Divergent has the US dollar been to gold prices I mean has this been surprising we're seeing obviously it's not really it's not about the US dollar anymore but typically in in its traditional fashion I think it's about the US dollar as a component on a more global scale right but I think again it comes back to how does the Dollar fit into diverse portfolios on a global scale and I think that you know whether the dollar strengthens or weakens again an element of what's going to move the price but at the end of the day you need to understand that retail investors institutional adoption of gold outside of the US it's still very strong and and actually coming back to the Western investor again there hasn't been the wholesale unwind of gold Investments that we may have seen in the past with a stre weaker or stronger dollar what you're seeing is people holding because again you have the Strategic drivers of gold and then you have tactical drivers of gold so when you have these moments of risk and you know every day I wake up and I see some piece of news that makes me think that there's something else on the horizon right you we had a banking crisis we had a conflict flare up in the Middle East which is still not resolved we had the Ukraine crisis those moments of shocks to portfolio you want the kind of diversification you get with the gold in your in your allocation I think that that's going to keep gold as a component of portfolios again on hold for an increase but right now I think it's staying firm in the portfolio Okay I also think correlations of bonds and equities when we have higher more sustained inflation they tend to correlate more together and actually that removes them as being the good diversifier in your portfolio so that's where I think we're getting a lot of dialogue going with our investors and people are talking to us about it in that context so on the US dollar front though have you seen because we have been seeing a decrease in that US dollar have you been seeing other jurisdictions where the conversion rates are just crazy and gold prices are different watching investors and consumers Pile in and take advantage of this low dollar well I think it it's probably played out I've said it a couple of times around the East I think there might be more going to China than maybe we would have expected I think that's probably what the case may be and is it a really a a dollar transaction or is it more of a rem andb transaction I think it's probably more of a what can I do with my REM andb without an ability to freely convert it and get it out of assets on Shore and I think that that's been more of a factor than than than what the US dollar is doing to some of these other foreign currencies I mean we mentioned a little bit about the election year going into it I mean a lot of G7 Nations going into an election year this year too uh talk to me a little bit about bricks talk to me about you know these countries coming together and trying to put us behind is this isn't a new trend this has happened but how important is it to be paying attention to things like this specifically on the policy side I think it's an interesting concept that's been talked about I think that uh the bricks Community met I think it was late last year they talked about the fact that they were looking at a number of really creative and interesting ideas and I just think practically speaking it's not something that's going to come to light anytime soon and I think it's more than just bricks I think it's really at how the global economies come together and work together and the significance of the dollar and dollar payment systems so when we hear this noise around bricks displacing the dollar or alienating the dollar away from what they need to rely on I don't think it's any more of a an appropriate label than any other just perspective on saying how does globalization play out I I really don't think it needs to be kind of categorized and say there's like this you know this weaponized kind of attack on the dollar I think it's it's it's misleading in many ways I think it makes for good headline yeah but honestly speaking I think the important thing to understand is look at a homegrown economy look at how Central bank's dealing with what they're facing and challenged on that whether it's part of bricks or not I think you can look at a market like turkey or Poland I think you're looking at those countries and you're simply seeing cold consumption by those central banks large consumption you know I don't think it's being driven by uh you know uh wanting to be a part of bricks and wanting to peel away or like I said weaponize the dollar it away um so I I'd say interesting but I wouldn't necessarily put a package on it and say it's something that's going to displace the dollar for now right let's talk a little bit about the mining side uh because that's a conference you just came from I'm curious you know you sit we sit and talk to CEOs all the time and as we discuss the Divergence of these metal prices to the equity prices they really haven't caught up but I'm more curious about whether we're going to have a supply issue here I mean we haven't had a lot of capital coming into the mining side for a very long time to a point where people are worried is the world gold Council concerned I don't think we're worried but what I would say is that actually um the mining sector is taking great advantage of the prices that we're at right now and I think that they're actually seeing that in terms of the level of production uh I think we had a record first quarter in terms of the overall production that came through for 2024 so what I would say is that when you look out long term there's definitely a need for us to continue to find new ways to bring more Supply online uh I think that 24 and 25 look to be very strong years for production it's beyond 25 that we should be paying attention to how the capital that's in the system could meet through the new projects could actually bring more Supply online and I think it's important for us to kind of highlight the fact that that was a big discussion here at cim this week which was talking about whether or not the right capital is coming to the industry well whether or not it's bringing it to um the industry at the right in the right ways and and I think there's a lot of work to do there but right now I think we look at the mining sector I think there's a lot of good work that it's doing around uh improving efficiency the consolidation has been an obvious area of um a lot of attention but ultimately 24 and 25 we could see record years in terms of the production Beyond 25 there that's where it starts to be um you know something we should keep an eye on right when you let's go back there for a second when you talk about the investment opportunities are you referring to you know funds coming in a little bit more of the mature money some institutional money that kind of thing I mean you know we've had segments on our show about the Canadian pension plans not even getting involved in our own sector so how do we influence this how do we make it a little bit more approachable this industry uh has a lot of very exciting uh Dynamic things that are happening you know I can highlight one around sourcing tracking and tracing gold from its site that's amazing work and that's actually a really exciting opportunity what the industry needs to keep doing is promoting that information getting that message out to say this is not your sleepy old mining industry this is an industry that's embraced ESG that's actually working on consolidating those standards amongst a number of organizations including our own to bring the most wholesome ESG framework together for an industry that can cost efficiently run to these standards they're using technology there's technological advances in terms of M exploration and and M in mind um the development and I just feel like it needs to do a lot more of talking about how it fits in into the value chain of something that ultimately gets onto a critical minerals list at the end or becomes vital to the way we all live and I think that being part of the value chain as opposed to just the mining sector is a really powerful message for the mining industry to adopt which is to Simply say we're part of your lives and I think that that was a big topic of discussion this week which is how do we fit in yeah how do we become part of the bigger discussion and on the money side I think it's interesting because you know there's there's a a wealth of money that's floating around in a high rate environment you know it might be a little challenging to get access to it but I think this is an industry that's actually really an interesting one to watch about how technology meets mining meets you know vital components of a of a supply chain that's actually going to be pretty important for all the things that are on our desktop yeah well let's talk about the grownup uh industry of gold I mean it doesn't seem as though it's just a hedge anymore we've seen a lot of inflows from even investors into Bitcoin understanding really what that means for them I can see younger generations starting to hold gold they're starting to buy you know gold ETFs so has that helped and give us your forecast this year where where are we going is this sustainable yeah so there's a couple of things to unpack there let me start by unpacking a little bit around uh cryptocurrency in the Bitcoin space you know there's been a very high-profile launch of exchange traded funds in the US we attract they they attracted and we saw what we were expecting which is a large inflow and kind of a bit of a stall in terms of the overall AUM at this point that's really giving a certain Community who may have already held it in one form or another certainty around a regulated Financial instrument so you're probably around 50 billion in terms of the AUM that's sitting in that right now but again it's actually concentrated amongst a few of the big players it's actually expensive and uh nothing's really changed fundamentally to the underlying asset it's still very volatile still a risk asset but it's given people that better rapper um but what we're seeing with gold and what I think is actually quite interesting about where the landscape is right now again I'm going to reemphasize the fact that we have seen outflows in ETF which is about 6% of the overall investment Market worldwide bars and coins investments in the East still driving the value a hold kind of a hold mentality on the west so I think overall what you're going to see is that a bit of a hold there until we start to see the opportunity cost improve for gold in the US in particular and that's going to be on the back of some form of movement on rates right and I I think uh or the rates sustain themselves for longer so that higher inflation environment which might move us back to uh that factor of driving investment dollars into gold so so we like the fact that the environment is right for consumption to improve in the western markets uh we see that the sustained case for gold in the East being very strong so that gives us comfort that these new higher levels that we're seeing look likely to be sustained so um our outlook for the year is continuing to a strong level of demand from central banks uh I think on the fabrication side the jewelry side with the higher prices probably a little bit slower a little bit less um but Western investors and investment demand to remain high and then overall in technology which is something we really haven't touched upon but with the introduction of more supercomputing AI different Technologies coming online we saw a big increase in demand 10% increase in demand for the technology space in first quarter of 24 so a small component but just uh an interesting little corner of the Market to keep an eye on as it matures correct okay uh talk to me a little bit before I let you go just about if we start to see some of this economic data play out you know again there's a lot of narrative rates going to be cut I was reporting on six of them back in January for goodness sake so there is a lot of narrative here but if we cut through the noise we see you know consumers buying buying buying at places like Costco if we start to see the economy do what it's meant to do here nobody's going to be selling that off is this here to stay yeah I think it is I think that it's making a strong case for it look I can't give good reasons for uh a large selloff in the gold price I think ultimately what you have again if you look at the global demand and you look at the global mechanisms for which people consume gold there's a strong case in each and I think the concentrations that I think even others have talked about on your program around the Reliance on China yes that's that's a concern but a Slowdown is a more likely outcome than a wholesale unwind of gold remember this is going to be slowing of Demand versus unwinding of demand yeah and I think that that continues to give us a strong case for the price to be supported Joe cavaton from the world gold Council of course he's a senior market strategist for the americaas there joining us in studio thanks again for

[Music] hey everyone I'm Jeremy Safford this is Kiko news thanks for joining us today don't forget to hit that subscribe button for the latest now today on chart this with Gary Wagner we're exploring the impact of the US dollar strength on precious medals like gold and silver and despite the broader Market facing challenges from Modest growth and persistent inflation the star of today's show is Nidia it's a company that has transformed from a niche chip fire to a dominant force in the tech industry fresh off of a blockbuster earnings report Nvidia continues to shatter expectations in the first quarter loan the revenue surged to 26 billion now that's a triple increase propelling them pass industry giants like McDonald's and MasterCard now with a stock price that is soared adding $1.1 trillion dollar in market cap or market capitalization this year nvidia's Journey mirrors the early days of the internet boom and of course ize all of this we welcome our buddy Gary Wagner our resident technical analyst and the editor of the Gold forecast.com T to code what these Market movements mean to people like you and I Gary it's been too long welcome back it has but it is great to be here and it is an exciting day uh for multiple uh Financial sectors isn't that the truth okay let's let's get straight to it I want to start by talking a little bit about the US dollar Gary uh you know it's showing significant strength and I'm kind of curious you know what the latest chart tells us about its movement you know can you highlight any key technical indicators that are currently in play here well absolutely if if we look at the dollar and I have a daily Candlestick chart we can see that roughly in about the middle of April it topped out at around 106 this of course is the dollar Index we saw it hit a double top and from there over a period of about a month till the middle of May Thursday the 16th it really hit a bottom at about 104 and it has gone up significantly over the last week roughly from 104 to 105 which means that it has increased in terms of its value against the basket of currencies And Trades against by a full percentage point in a currency that is a lot uh the dollar has been on solid footing moving to the upside for over a week in terms of trading okay well as the FED maintains a cautious stance on interest rates you know let's talk a little bit more about those signals that at least Traders should watch that might indicate a shift in the trajectory here is there an up is there a down where we go from here well of course the most recent reaction that we saw in the precious metals and other markets was the release the other day of the fomc meeting minutes from the last meeting meeting that of course came out prior to the most recent CPI data that followed the information that the Federal Reserve had at the time of the meeting was that all through last year we had a methodical and steady downtick in inflation moving to their 2% trajectory that kind of changed in January February and March when we got an accelerated or elevated reading in other words a slight uptick and that's what the Federal Reserve was talking about because the minutes of course is the discussion between Federal Reserve officials it did not take into account the most recent inflation report that actually showed a once again another downtick so I think that we had Market participants being over optimistic prior to the release of the minutes uh wishing that the First Rate cut would first come in June then September now it's in question as to whether or not there will be three more likely two some are calling for one yeah but the key is that the market participant were reacting to minutes that came out before the latest report the only caveat to that is that the FED is on record saying that one month does not make a trend they need to see meaningful data on a series of months so what is important to watch is the upcoming readings of the pce and the CPI because that will really determine the forward trajectory of multiple asset classes Yeah Yeah you mentioned it here kind of in a waiting pattern but we've seen some resilience on some of the precious metal side but you know talking about gold Gary when we talk about the US dollar you know that inverse relationship pull up a gold chart because it's been so fascinating we've seen these all-time highs as volatility can you talk about when Traders or when people were reacting does that reflect on the chart as well yeah well if let's take a look before I switch over the dollar has been up for the last six trading days and during that time we had gold move higher with the dollar moving higher and then of course over the last three days it came down substantially and so it's almost been as though the the dollar hasn't played a significant role and the key is is that all of the precious metals are paired against the dollar there's a 100% inverse or negative correlation between a dollar strength and how the metals do a strong dollar will take Gold Silver Platinum Palladium all of the precious metals lower BAS Bas based upon the fact that it's paired against it but whereas we saw dollar strength we saw dollar strength while gold and silver were moving higher we saw dollar strength as gold and silver moved lower so the dollar has not not been the most important factor but rather buyers or sellers dominating the market okay so you know given the dollar strength what would be a significant technical development or you know a pattern Gary that could possibly make this a reversal or continued weakness in gold prices here well I believe that we're seeing an overreaction a really strong knee-jerk reaction because we were down $33 yesterday and another 50 today so that's an $80 decline due to directly attributable I should say to the releas of the fomc meeting minutes those minutes as I talked about a second ago came in prior to new information conveying the opposite or what the FED actually wants to see so on a technical basis real support comes in at around 2300 that's these series of bottoms that came in in in May and then April here but the fact of the matter is we could see gold find tentative support roughly at 2320 that's the next Target that I have and we're currently at 2331 of course I'm looking at June Futures what we'll want to see is we've got good volume but we also have a holiday weekend coming up and so that will always add some volatility to the market but I'm not convinced that we are witnessing a a full a fullblown correction yet it's certainly more than a oneoff because we've seen the second day and it's a a very very strong decline but the other thing that's noteworthy is it's not a decline from gold in a mid-range uh in a price point it's been to before this decline is occurring immediately following a new all-time record high so it gives um shorter term and interim Traders the ability to pull profits um based on the recent move and the recent move really was from about 2300 up to 2440 and above and so a $100 in terms of a decline over let's say the last two days in perspective is not that great so I'm not convinced we're looking at a full-blown correction but if it is a correction this is how it would look at the beginning so we need more data to determine and we need to see what the fundamental reports that are upcoming over the next say 3 weeks as inflation reports come in again and we get some signals from the FED as to what they're going to do in regards to rate cuts the magnitude meaning the amount of cuts and the timing of those cuts they have pretty much taken a uh a rate hike off the table and that of course is very very bullish but rates are high now yeah they're high and and as you said I mean we started the year with six or seven right cuts that was the narrative at least that's what we were covering here we are possibly one some people saying maybe none at all I'm curious is the volatility still affecting silver is it somewhat similar is there specific patterns emerging that differ from gold or is it kind of a same approach here on the profit side well you know Silver's been interesting because the percentage gains re recently L have been enormous in other words when gold was moving up 1% 3/4 of a percent silver was moving up 3% here is a four four and a half% move uh just shy of 3% it hit a high that has not been seen and we really have to go far back but it's not been seen really since February of 21 and this top here which comes in in May so it's been a long time since we've seen Silver hit this exaggerated high and to go beyond that we've really got to go back into August of 2020 so it's been a long wait for uh what what I'll call Silver stackers out there they have been waiting for a move like this and considering that silver moved from $26 to almost $33 in under three weeks is really significant because we've seen gold make series of record highs we've not seen Silver follow suit this time we've seen Silver move along with gold with larger percentage gains and the declines have been about on par with the percentage declines of gold it's been exceedingly strong and so the key is it did break above 30 it traded to a high of almost 33 the key to me is maintaining a price point above 30 specifically 2950 is really important but 30 is going to be a point in which some sellers could emerge a break below that yeah we had a lot of people come on and say 30 is so important just keep holding 30 when you look at that chart is there anything that you can see about the future price Direction here Gary in terms of a forecast Forest well what I can see is when we look I mean when we look at Major bottoms nothing comes in the beginning of this rally we do have this resistance area that comes in at 29 a half which is why that's an important number to me based on these particular tops back in April but we had such strong moves and although they weren't true price gaps because you do get this Wick the wick is the differential between this real body which is the open and close in green it means it closed above the open in red it means it closed below the open but the fact is is that you had a price void in essence here a very small one here and so it really gapped higher in a very very uh not violent but exceedingly strong Manner and it to me showed pent up buying demand emerging once we got real breakouts above 29 and it took it way past 30 silver has been impressive yeah I mean the medals have been so interesting just to watch even over the past couple of weeks here Gary but you're see here what I'm hearing from you is maybe a little bit more smoke than fire a little trigger happy on those buttons perhaps well whenever you get a surge that is takes up gold or silver any of the metals dramatically higher when it does hit a scenario in which Market participants believe that it's overbought it's going to come down as significantly as it went up so a a brilliant move up calls for a dramatic move down you typically don't get a mild or tepid um price drop or correction following a surge and really if you look at this this is a real surge I mean you're looking at in a period of a under a week going from 28 to 3275 that's a huge move yeah absolutely it sure is we'll continue to keep an eye on that you know as I watch the markets today everything quite red everything under a little bit of pressure but as we talked about in the introduction Nvidia has been the darling I mean recently posting impressive earnings driving significant movement to its stock price you know I'm so curious from a technical analyst perspective how did the earning surge impact the chart here and uh were you surprised well you know Nvidia has outperformed pretty much all of the other companies equities out there considering that it surged by 10% today doesn't surprise me in that the estimates the earning estimates prior to the announcement the other day were exceedingly high they were a high Benchmark to reach and then when the report came out they exceeded that bench Mark they are the only game in town um for AI right now they're developing a new platform called Blackwell and that is significant and they're keeping it in the same price range between anticipated between 30 and 40,000 and this is not a single CPU chip but rather a rack of chips that are all related and it does have the to really transform and speed up the development in AI projects globally and that is significant there is no other company producing technology to the level that Nvidia is and it's hard to see any company like AMD or Intel catching up with them because they are so far ahead of the curve so the fact that it's up currently uh I mean it Rose I I think 10% well 99.32% but if you look at this daily chart you have this former top at around 958 it comes down and then hits this top just prior to the earning and gaps substantially higher now the big news right now with Nvidia is they announced a a 10 to1 stock split which makes sense now that it's over a thousand I don't think that there's another uh chip maker that can touch them for AI development uh gpus in the case of Nvidia yeah for processing power even even the others in their peers in the markets today were a little bit red you know with such a strong performance there are technical signs that might suggest I don't know an overextension or are we going to continue to see this gross here at least some profit taking I mean we're just expecting the market to take a breath but this one's resilient this is 100% % fundamentally based yeah as long as they have an edge and that edge is significant it's more than significant because the other dominant players such as Intel AMD do not have any product that will substitute what this new Blackwell will or their former um AI chips which is the Cornerstone of all of these centers that are doing large large language model learning things that require a t a tremendous amount of processing power and there's no other company that is able to deliver the solution needed by these companies to move forward and everybody is getting into the a game whether it's Google releasing Gemini um Microsoft releasing their new platform All of You know open AI all of the former players like chat gbt there's Claude now Tesla's coming out with a or it has has been a real active player in AI so all of the primary players are dependent upon Nvidia to continue to grow their models and to train their systems and to develop the products they are developing and those products are transforming the workplace the way you and I and others around the world work because we're implementing the earliest stages of these products now yeah yeah it's almost like I said at the beginning there it almost looks like we're at the beginning of the internet boom once again only it's the AI boom I'm curious Gary when you look at the markets before I let you go here and you look at the overall strength of what you're seeing today as a Trader is there anything that's surprising you about the macro situation just about the way that they're reacting in this environment well it takes me back to one of my earliest mentors uh when I first got in the industry and this is back in 83 and '84 so it dates me but I looked at charts and and studied fundamentals and the first thing I was taught about equities was that it's not a stock market but a market of stocks so it's not so much about these sectors because sectors are going to to run with certain demands whether Automotive sector running hot or cold but something like Ai and the technology needed to move forward with it the demand is huge and there is only one pair of shoes that are currently is filling that demand and the curve to become competitive such as AMD or or Intel coming up with a alternative is so far removed from what they're able to produce now it seems as though the domination and dominance of Nvidia can only Excel and can only get stronger and so I would look for particular stocks rather than Market sectors right now in terms of investing dollars in strength yeah well said and well put uh thanks my friend we're out of time already that's Gary Wagner of course editor of the forecast.com and our chief analyst I would say on the technical side we appreciate you coming on all the way from Hawaii Today Gary again great to be here as always and uh I look forward to uh doing this again and sharing our knowledge with our viewers yeah I

[Music] on the spot with Michelle mccy is brought to you by Swan Bitcoin hello I'm Michelle mccy thank you for joining us Bitcoin gold and silver all have no Associated cash flow or yield yet all three assets have been on an upward trajectory in 2024 with gold making the oldtime highs and up nearly 133% here to date silver just this week rising to its highest level in more than a decade up more than 26% so far this year and Bitcoin of course hit a new all-time high in March and approached its record high again this week and is up 60% so far for 2024 so can we see this rally continue let's get some analysis and price forecasts from Florian grumes managing director of Midas Touch Consulting Florian has over three decades of experience in the financial markets and he is known for his contrarian thinking he was one of the first to call for the crypto winter back in January 2018 and he's also a fan favorite here on Kitco welcome back Floria nice to see you thanks for having me Michelle it's great to be back on Kito always good to have you floran let's kick it off with Bitcoin now in the last two weeks Bitcoin has been trading in that 60,000 to 70,000 range it moved above 71,000 early in the week currently sitting around 67,000 you're today State up 60% as I mentioned we did have that all-time high of just under 74,000 in March what's next here Florian what are the charts telling you yeah let me share my screen here um so obviously um I'm only cooking with water like everybody else I have no crysal ball um but I'm giving my best and honest uh analysis here so the first one uh that I would like to CH chart here is um Bitcoin ver versus the NASDAQ I think it's pretty obvious that Bitcoin is very much correlated with the stock market and you can see here Bitcoin versus The Wisdom Tree three times leverage ETF obviously it's not exactly one to one but they match each other pretty much and um so you can make the case that Bitcoin and tech stocks are strongly correlated and if that is the case and I think it's obvious H then we have to look at stock market uh seasonality and uh I need to remind you of the old adage sell and May and go away this is the Dow John seasonality over the last 127 years usually you'll find the top somewhere early May and then towards an into the the late summer Early Autumn around October September usually the worst months is September uh stock markets have a pullback and that's also the best time to buy uh the stocks and then usually they have a nice year end rally so uh since Bitcoin and tech stocks are strongly correlated uh we can see similar pattern in Bitcoin seasonality usually Bitcoin tops out somewhere in May June and then has a downtrend into September and October and uh you can see August and September are usually the worst months for for Bitcoin so I personally look for a bottom and a good buying opportunity somewhere in the time frame because to the end of the year then you usually get a strong Bitcoin rally again and if you remember last year it pretty much matched that seasonal uh pattern um it was I think in mid October when the ETF hype started and Bitcoin was able to start the rally uh at 25,000 and went up all the way to to 75,000 the following months so that's kind of like the the the seasonal uh analysis here um which I always like as a first layer and then we can look into further into the technicals here so sell and May and go away so let's talk about the technicals in terms of you know what support level do you see for that projected bottom in September where you say it could be a good buying opportunity what what are the sort of support lines that you anticipate as we see Bitcoin starting to sell off sure look uh let's zoom out a little bit further first um this is the Bitcoin chart over the last uh five years you can see this big bull market between 2019 and 2020 21 when Bitcoin topped out at 69,000 in November 2021 you had this bare Market minus 75% pullback uh that's hard to to sit out but if you're hling it you had to and we had a very nice bottom here in December 2020 uh2 January 2023 I came out with a very bullish piece back then I said Bitcoin is going back to 50K it took a bit longer than I expected initially um this is the octob September October I just talked about last year that's where the ETF hype basically started and overall we've seen a rally of 3 176% within 16 months from the lows of that bare market so that's a pretty strong rise of course if you compare it to uh uh former Bitcoin Ries it's maybe a little bit disappointing but overall it's still a very strong rise and what you can also see on this chart already is that Bitcoin is kind of like stalling out here consolidating going sideways trading basically between 60 and 70k most of the time so if we zoom in uh onto the the daily chart here uh you can I mean that's my case I'm making the case that Bitcoin is probably working on a cup and handle pattern here um and this is the strong resistance that it needs to break through currently sitting roughly speaking around 74 75,000 usually these cup and handle patterns uh take more time than most people uh uh anticipate and wish for uh so we've seen a similar pattern much larger actually in the gold market the last 13 years I don't think it's going to take that long for Bitcoin but at least I would say a few more months here for the handle uh of course if it's going to be a beautiful Italian espresso cup then maybe the handle might be a bit smaller who knows but um generally speaking I assume a pullback over the the weaker summer months into let's say 48 to 50,000 kind of range if Bitcoin were to retrace the the 38.2% retracement from this whole R since the bare Market low we talking about $52,500 so that's basically the the range that I see and maybe more or less we could see something like this so that means somehow a low towards September October maybe and then uh really towards the end of the year and a breakout above uh 75,000 which would then take us quickly probably to 90 to $100,000 wow okay so you could see it uh dropping as low as 48,000 48 50,000 as as a a support line in that summer doldrum it could be that's not necessarily the worst case scenario it's it's also not the best case scenario I I I mean we doubt that Bitcoin can be very volatile right if you remember the last uh bull market started at 3,200 Bitcoin went up to nearly 14,000 and then came all the way back to 3,800 during the corona crash and then it took off to 69,000 so uh this asset is volatile um and uh could easily pull back again below 60k below 55k maybe even below 50K yeah but I don't think it will stay there for a long time so probably would be a quick Spike we know it's a volatile asset that much we know Florian um not not for those with a weak stomach so what would be the narrative then do you think that could send it driving up higher to a new alltime high that you expect in uh by the end of the year what would be the Catalyst for that what could be the narrative yeah I mean you're making a good point here because I think that's also so a little bit of problem right now that there is no real new narrative for Bitcoin at the moment so since the ETF is out what more of and the Haring exactly so um the the only narrative that is around the corner at the moment is the the ethereum ETF but um for Bitcoin it probably will be just new liquidity injections by the central banks um I think that will be the main uh driver over over the next uh one and a half two years so generally speaking I mean at some point most likely they will be forced to lower interest rates again uh stabilize the financial system with more injections like they did last year over one weekend printing 400 billion dollar base money so things like that uh could quickly become the new narrative then for Bitcoin and and could drive prices strongly higher again so fed injecting liquidity into the market via rate cuts or some other way uh you know you mentioned obviously Bitcoin a volatile asset we certainly know that and we recently this week celebrated Bitcoin Pizza day that's on May 22nd and of course that's the historic event commemorating when in 2010 a Bitcoin developer paid 10,000 Bitcoin for two Papa John's Pizzas and we know it was the first real transaction for Bitcoin hence a very momentous time value of 10,000 Bitcoin amounted to about $41 in 2010 so at today's prices that would be around $700 million that is a very expensive uh paycheck for a a price tag for two pizzas there Florian now speaking of volatility last year the uh price on bitcoin Pizza day was 26773 right in 2023 we're at uh it was around just under 70,000 L Pizza Bitcoin Pizza week so where do you see Bitcoin at the next Bitcoin Pizza day considering we had such a difference between this year and last year of 26,700 give or take May May 22 of 2025 where do you see I would say 100 above 100,000 for sure maybe around 120,000 um I think if it breaks above that 75,000 resistance level it could actually rally quite quickly um so yeah let's say 120,000 okay 120,000 Bitcoin by next Bitcoin Pizza day Florian equally important question what is your favorite pizza topping oh that's a good question um I think it's just mozzarella just mozzarella that's not a topping yeah yeah yeah all right you like the plain cheese pizza uh I like olives olives are my favorite topping um you know olives I like a napolitana olives and chies like some mushrooms controversial position I really also like a Hawaiian pizza pineapple uh I know that's not a very popular opinion but uh I'm going to stick I'm going to stick with that and I will say definitively that broccoli has no place in a pizza okay and now speaking of some controversial opinions um there certainly was a lot of controversy when we had black rock the world's largest asset manager stepping into the Bitcoin space and we certainly didn't think that we'd see institutions back in 2010 launching spot Bitcoin ETFs and it has been an issue of debate much like pineapple on Pizza as to whether it's actually contrary to the ethos of Bitcoin to have it now embroiled in the traditional Financial system which was It was supposed to be accounted to uh and there's been some recent concerns expressed by Tyler Duran uh that is the pseudonym for Zero Hedge or the posts under Zero Hedge content and he posted on X by the way Tyler Jordan is also part of the digital asset fund soap capital and of course uh the name coming from Fight Club for those that where they made soap as as another reference there but that's the pseudonim for Zero Hedge which has a lot of credibility uh in terms of its information and he posted on X that black rock can take as much Bitcoin as they want from coinbase and the transaction is recorded off chain I'd like to see all of the etf's wallets this means they can borrow Bitcoin from coinbase to short and are not required to show any proof they hold one to one there's also a 2 to 30-day settlement all settlements are done in cash the writing is on the wall unless someone can find the ETF Wallets on Shain there's a leaked trade a few weeks ago someone a very large entity pck ped Bitcoin and micro strategy at the same time godspeed my brothers now this expost comes in reference to the fine print in the ETF which reads um what what they have there in terms of what coinbase posted up there so what do you make of this Florian I mean how concerned should we be about that well the ETF is the main reason that I lost a bit of my enthusiasm for Bitcoin um I mean I bought my first Bitcoin below $100 in early 2013 and I was amazed by the sound money idea and I really fell in love with Bitcoin but uh I've been always very skeptic of this uh ETF um because first of all I don't trust in ETFs generally speaking and in this specific case I mean the Mantra is not your keys not your coins and in this case you buy basically a derivative of Bitcoin yes maybe most likely the institutional uh issuer of the ETF will buy those Bitcoins but it's hard to really control uh and and it it to me it feels like a black boss they can do lots of things behind the curtain basically and um You Don't Own the Bitcoin you just own basically an IOU and and so I I think it's the only thing that's now happening is a big speculation um but uh it's not the original idea of Satoshi anymore and so I I I I never understood the the Euphoria about the the Bitcoin ETFs of course in terms of price it will help to push Bitcoin above 100K but uh the original idea I think is perverted and um that's why I lost a bit of my enthusiasm for for Bitcoin and um uh I I I would never touch those ETFs personally right you take self custody of your Bitcoin not your keys not your coin um but you know in terms of price this has been a positive for the price can this be a negative for the price when you have these big players in control here well I think that the the big institutional money and basically Wall Street realized that they cannot control and conquer the Bitcoin Network so they decided to embrace it and um now those ETF uh um issuers those ETF Banks like Black Rock I mean they're going to be the largest holder ofit Bitcoins and what can you do I mean you're completely depending on on uh how they want to play prices in the end of the day I mean we had these discussions over the last 20 years with the with the gold ETF the GLD when it came out and it's still uh questionable if all of the gold that they are supposed to hold is really there we've also seen that during the bare Market in gold in 2011 to 2015 all these ETF holders quickly sold their their gold with one Mouse click and um I think also that they they took away a lot from the from the the the money flow towards mining stocks but um it it's it's not the original idea of Bitcoin anymore so I'm very skeptic about this in the long run does this make you question Bitcoin as a long-term store of value Asset then yes it does does it make you question it to the degree that you're selling your Bitcoin no I mean I'm I'm an investor I'm a Trader I'm a Speculator and I I I think we're going to see higher prices in Bitcoin so right now there is no reason and especially if we are in the bull market you want to buy the dips and and that's what I'm planning to do hopefully in September October yeah to be determined as uh we said what the involvement of institutional players in the Bitcoin ecosystem can be if it's a long-term negative or a long-term positive but you know as you mentioned you do have these synthetic ETF products which in a way corrupt the purity of the core asset and we're now waiting for approval of the eth ETF spot ETF it doesn't look like it's happening today the deadline came and went and we did have six issuers including Black Rock updating copies of their ETF proposals ahead of a decision that was expected today all applications removed plans to stake the token which is interesting and that signals that that activity may have been one of the regulatory roadblocks to approval there uh so the SEC had to make a fin decision but it doesn't seem like it came up with anything end of day Thursday without getting too much into the eth story here do you think it is likely to happen that we now have an eth spot ETF um it looks like because uh I need to remind you that 99% or 99.9% of the ETF applications by um Black Rock have been approved so well there is that there is that little statistic if Black Rock uh wants one approved it usually gets approved yes so I think breaking it down to simple terms I think that's that's probably what's going to happen so and we know that Larry think the COO of Black Rock has been very strong on tokenization and tokenization of all assets and that would probably involve uh the ethereum blockchain hence he could have a desire to get this uh ETF approved what would it mean in terms of impact on bitcoin demand or on the price of Bitcoin very different assets obviously for those that that understand the the crypto world right but for those retail investors that may not have the finer understanding of why Bitcoin is so different from eth and just say hey I want some crypto exposure to my portfolio what do you think that could mean for Bitcoin demand could that be a positive could that be a negative I I would say it's probably more of a positive in terms of prices um I think there's generally more demand more attention coming to digital assets um so the whole crypto sector will obviously profit from it um the main driver should be in that case ethereum I mean you've seen it since a few days it's started to to run higher so um I think primarily e and the altcoin sector will will profit from it but it should also at least support uh uh Bitcoin prices right and you know a lot of this change from the SEC and Gary Gensler it's believed to be very politically motivated ahead of the election there is increasing bipartisan support for digital assets at large from all of Congress and former president Trump he said that he'd embrace the use of crypto and and the Biden administration's regulatory hostility as he puts it towards the industry the Trump campaign is also now accepting Don ations in Bitcoin and in cryptocurrency so really leaning into that voter base I know you're over there in Bavaria in the lovely Countryside of Bavaria Germany but do you see Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies becoming a much bigger issue in this political cycle yeah I mean I think it's obvious that uh Trump wants to get the votes of the young people and um Joe Biden so far has has been pretty much against crypto um so I think it's obvious what what Trump's Trump wants to achieve here and and it makes sense I mean it's it's it's a big topic among young people nowadays and so it will play a role in this election yes right so we could probably see a lot more bipartisan support for Bitcoin let's move on to Gold let's go from digital gold to real physical gold and gold hit new all-time highs uh on Monday we had spot prices rising to $2,450 an ounce well has retraced back uh a little bit in fact more than $100 it's currently at around 2,330 so help us break down what we're seeing with gold what are the support and resistance levels here yeah okay let's look at a long-term chart here for gold first so um this is actually a monthly chart going back to uh 19 1998 and and um what you can see here is this beautiful long-term cup and handle pattern and finally gold managed to break out uh in February March this year so this pattern has been in the making for 13 years and uh many times over the last two three years I have want uh gold investors that this handle here on the right side might take longer than they anticipate and in the end it did um but now we have the breakout the pattern is confirmed and gold basically ried since uh last October 35% in seven and a half months that's pretty good for the old-fashioned gold of course the crypto friends uh might not be too too Amazed by this but for gold it's a big move and if we zoom in here into the gold chart uh you can see that this is the resistance line that gold had been running against the $275 range and finally in uh late February early March we got sustainable breakout and quickly gold ried up to $2,431 very nice rally and uh this is the top here in mid of May H it came all the way back down to 2277 and thanks to Silver which took the lead uh gold also pulled back up again and managed to reach a new all-time high this Monday at 2,450 but since then we clearly see a strong pullback again and um looks like it's dropping like a stone at the moment um it's down already $120 from the top on Monday and um yeah you you could you can make the case that this might be a double top you can make the case that it looks a bit tired the gold price in the in the last few weeks um my initial Target was at 2535 so far we made it up to 2,450 um seasonality is now not that constructive anymore for the gold price or for precious metals uh generally speaking and we got a new sell signal as of uh yesterday so um I could imagine and that is my best case scenario at the moment for gold that we maybe pull back further obviously in the very short term we might get a pop on on Friday and Monday because it's getting very oversold here but uh we might test this 1300 uh $2,300 2,280 is kind of range again maybe one more Spike higher one more test of the $2,400 and then we have actually a head and shoulders stopping pattern in the place and um usually these breakout relies are getting retraced and usually gold needs to test that breakout Zone I would say 2,100 to 2,100 50 is typically a pullback that we should expect over the next few months um if we look at the seasonality for gold you can see that actually since mid April early May um this this this pattern is already pointing towards lower prices normally early Midsummer somewhere in July uh gold finds a finds a low but for the next few weeks uh I I would be I would be careful so um we had a big run I showed it 3 7% in in seven and a half months uh usually gold needs to take a breather here pull back towards this breakout Zone $2,100 and that would be a perfect buying spot because in the longer run I expect gold to run to $33,000 now that it has broken Above This long-term resistance Zone but it needs to cool down needs to take a breather um that would be my main scenario right now of course there's also um a geopolitical component because I think this gold rally has been mainly driven by physical demand from China and from central banks and the Chinese have been buying gold like crazy uh I published a piece in February uh where I clearly laid out why I think gold is now breaking out because we've seen these pictures out of China uh during the New Year celebrations over there you've seen thousands and thousands of people in these shopping centers trying to get their hands on physical gold and and still until today the the gold and silver pric is in Shanghai trading with the premium and that's the big question how quickly will the Chinese buyers coming back into the market actually and of course you're just talking about the retail buyers we know that China's Central Bank The People's Bank of China has been on a massive gold buying spree adding to its gold reserves for 18 months in a row I let's talk about though you said that you do see gold pulling back to 2,50 around there roughly speaking yeah what why what what what are the pullback criteria you said that you're getting a sell signal what's what's the sell signal is it just profit taking what are the factors behind this pullback yeah I mean it's always takes people to pull prices higher and then at some point people sitting on nice profits and they also want to take those profits off the table and um in during those Ries you you certainly see a lot of people joining that rally and using Leverage and um again I I mentioned the seasonal pattern uh you've seen also that there was not a lot of Demand by the gold ETFs in in in the in the west um so yeah usually I mean nothing goes up in the straight line uh so it would be healthy to take a breather here and test this breakout which is now support former resistance has become support now so that would be the classical pattern and I've seen this a few times over the last 25 years in the gold market so um fundamentally speaking Yeah I mean maybe there some things are cooling down again you mentioned the Asian buyer as well I mean these are usually more contrarian type of buyers so we've seen that the demand has been cooling off a little bit in in the last few weeks so usually they wait for lower prices um I think there's and markets are simply overboard I mean if you look at weekly chart the daily chart become very overboard and um as I mentioned before we made only a slightly higher High I mean the high the high in in April was at 2431 now last Monday it it made it to 2450 it's just 20 bucks higher I I would have thought that as a final search for this rally you would like to see prices go vertical but this hasn't happened yet or or did not happen at all so uh I think at least you see more and more signals on the table now that there might be a reversal and that that we're now seeing a pullback in in the precious metals and in Gold but you're comfortable with uh that bottom at for gold at around 2100 yeah I I would be surprised if it goes much lower I mean this would only be the case if we get into a deflationary crash of course then everything will sell off and then gold could also go lower there is still an open Gap at 1830 right now I don't see how we going to get there but in a deflationary crash in the stock market crash yes this could happen but right now there are no indications on the table for that all right um let's talk about what you see for gold at at 3,000 do you see that for 2024 no I'm not sure if we make it until the end of the year but I think over the next one two years we we probably see gold at $3,000 yes yes I mean hold at $33,000 when yeah over the next one or two years I mean again there's a lot of uh potential scenarios on the table and I mentioned the geopolitical situation uh uh we have the ongoing Ukraine war which seems to continuously escalate uh we have today as of today new escalation in Taiwan uh a few days ago the Iranian president died in a in a helicopter crash uh there was a coup in Congo I mean there's so much going on and it's all pointing between the the the go the cold war between the the East and the West between America and China and I think the Chinese trying to get rid of as much us bonds and and treasuries and dollars as much and quick as they can uh and and of course they buying gold uh Floren we just got some breaking news that that eth ETF does seem to be moving towards the approval process um let's talk about silver and then we'll Circle back to bitcoin uh and and what this could mean for that um so we've got silver let's focus on Silver now silver climbing to around $32 an ounce this week and that's the highest level since 2012 silver trading at around $30.10 at the moment what's your outlook there yeah look uh silver um has finally joined the party over the last uh few weeks um unfortunately uh this most of the time is not a good signal for for the immediate future so usually when when silver shows up to the party it means that a bull market in the sector is coming to an end or a bull run the rally that started in October but let's zoom out a little bit because uh there has been a very important development in the silver market so this is the silver chart going back to 2010 and um uh silver uh made it top at 50 in May 2011 um the old alltime high from 1980 at $50 is still in Place Silver is one of the very few Commodities that is trading far below its 1980 High um so silver came back from that top at $50 uh down to 1150 in the corona crash 2020 and then strongly recovered up to $30 and over the following three and a half years it tried a few times to break through that resistance and it failed it didn't manage to break through and similar to to the the cup and handle uh pattern in the gold market we've seen kind of a basing cup pattern here in in silver over the last three and a half years and the big development over the last few weeks is that silver broke through that trend line here and that basically Unleashed new powers and energy and silver ried and spiked higher up to I think 32 50ish kind of dollars as of Monday so if we zoom in to the daily chart uh this is the rally that started in early March and uh this was basically the the pullback in in April and from there uh silver stormed higher over the last few weeks and um made a made a new I think 11year high at uh $32 45 I think so now we see this kind of like pullback or reversal at the moment we have a sell signal here on the daily stochastic and best case for silver I mean the former resistance at $30 is now support maybe it pulls back 29 30ish in that range I mean we made it already to that number today $30 I have a Target at 2930 something uh that could be uh the target for that pullback and if silver still has more fuel in the tank then we might see $35 in in the next few weeks but that's really the best case scenario um as I mentioned before usually when silver shows up to the party and takes the lead and that is what happened over the last five weeks usually it means the end of a bull run in the precious metal sector so we have to be very careful here and if Sila cannot defend this support zone now we might also get this kind of scenario where Sil would all pull back all the way to maybe $26 and then again uh the gold and silver Bucks have to uh show more patience like they've been doing for so many years already but uh uh I think um that's the two scenarios that I have for silver best case would be we get one more leg higher towards 35ish kind of dollars otherwise it has topped already and we are in the pullback already when am I getting this triple digit Sila that I've been promised for the last uh 3 years look I am definitely in the camp that silver will go back to $50 at some point and I'm also believing that we're going to see three three digit silver at some point some point what is the some point here well as years five years no I think with I think within the next five years uh it's very likely I think that uh generally speaking uh the the setup is uh uh accelerating um I I don't think we're going to get another multi- gear kind of consolidation correction in the precious metals this is a bull market we might see a a painful pullback over the next few weeks but uh once this is done uh gold will be back up and uh silver will follow and at some point Sila will take the lead and remember 2010 silver went from $17 to 15 $50 uh eight months super strong rally um something like this will happen again uh this the gold silver ratio uh uh has turned um I think uh in the longer run it looks very good for for silver however just sharing this last uh chart here um if you look at the silver sentiment um the Silver Box became very euphoric in the last few days I have to say so um that's usually uh to be taken very carefully that's usually a negative right that's that's usually a contrary indicator um I want to Circle back to eth now as I said we did get some news that the uh SEC has approved all the spot ethereum ETFs ethereum ring on this news now to be clear this doesn't mean that they're going to begin trading tomorrow or anytime soon it's just the 19 before approval it also needs to go through another approval process on the S1 documents that's going to take some time so we're expecting it to take a couple of weeks until it's officially there uh should know more details um as you said in the beginning of this interview with black Rock's uh Goden application chances it's going to get approved and of course Black Rock Fidelity um and and Grace scale amongst the ones that have had their e uh ETF spot ETFs approved so again we covered this already but what do you think this means now well I think that this probably will spark a little bit of an altcoin rally here as well and it will push ethereum higher um so probably Bitcoin dominance will go uh back a little bit um and yeah ethereum I mean don't forget uh Bitcoin has made a new all-time high ethereum has not made a new alltime high yet so um there is still room to catch up and again similar to what I talked about gold and silver once you see the ethereum and the coins catching up and doing their own thing it also means that a rally in the sector comes to an end so uh usually if you get this and this might be the booster this might be now the narrative that takes ethereum to a new all-time high over the next couple of weeks uh but that would also mean that in the larger scheme of things the crypto sector is is ready for a pullback um and a larger correction maybe into September October hence that sell in May hence hence that sell in May um but you still see Bitcoin at 100 or 120 come next Bitcoin Pizza Day May 22nd 2025 with your plain Mozzarella Pizza um as as as we wrap up here Florian you know started at the top mentioning how gold Bitcoin silver have no yield effectively right um no cash flow assets and yet they've been on such an upwards trajectory final thoughts on that note as we wrap up here yeah I think that the the crackup boom that we talked in depth I think 10 months ago and that I laid out many times over the last four years um still continues and uh it's all driven by money injection money Printing and the loss of confidence by the people and um we have now all of us basically are experiencing High inflationary uh setups constantly every day all over the world and so uh you cannot let and leave your money in the bank you need to do something with it and um Gold Silver and also Bitcoin are for me Safe Haven assets that are not that uh easily created H so I think of course the TCH stocks also have done very well um but Gold Silver and Bitcoin for me is still a a very very good uh combination to preserve your wealth and uh given the fact that they will continue to extend the the money supply um I think all those three assets will move higher over the long run all right yeah we'll bring it back to inflation and back to pizza and I'm lamenting the fact that we used to have $1 one slice pizza places here in New York no longer floran can no longer get a $1 slice of pizza in New York that's inflation for you the crack up boo as as you called it with money just running into assets to try and avoid that debasement and devaluation always get to see you I look forward to sharing a pizza with

hey everyone I'm Jeremy zern this is Kiko news don't forget to hit that subscribe button for the latest now this week the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ have been under pressure reacting to mixed economic signals and anticipation of Federal Reserve actions now the latest GDP now estimate shows a 3.5% growth rate for the second quarter of 2024 but consumer sentiment has dropped to a six-month low according to the University of Michigan now this combination of growth and underlying concerns is creating uncertainty among investors to say the least major uh financial institutions including Goldman Sachs now predict the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September with December also being a possibility the speculation has influenced bond yields and stock performance as investors try to position themselves ahead of potential changes in monetary policy and despite low consumer sentiment driven by high prices and economic uncertainties we've seen a strong job market with 175,000 jobs added in April and this resilience in empy employment suggests underlying strength in the US economy even as consumers continue to feel the pinch of higher costs now to help us make sense of these developments we welcome back Ted Oakley managing partner and founder of Oxo advisors with over 40 years of experiencing advising High net worth clients Ted you've seen a thing or two welcome back to the show all right Jeremy thank you I appreciate your time today uh let's jump right into it as I said in the intro GDP now estimates for Q2 uh moderate growth 3 1/2% but consumer sentiment is at a 6-month low uh Ted with these mixed signals what do you think this means for the economy in the second half of this year and what indicators should investors be watching closely for here well you know Jeremy I don't use the uh GDP forecast too much they missed it by about 25% in the first quarter so I would be I wouldn't be surprised if they don't miss it in the second quarter but I think it could be lower not stronger you know a lot of GD P right now comes from inflation you know look at prices and things you do more business that perks up I don't think the economy is that strong I think it's a real mixed bag uh people with you know upper upper echelons with a lot of money you know they're okay they feel okay the Market's High the real estate's good but you know over half the country right now is in pain you know they can't meet bills and I think that's the bicationic numbers showing up in that you see in real estate you see a lot of things where um you know like the PMI Services manufacturing they've just gone back and forth a little bit we haven't had a lot of change actually uh one way or the other and I think investors uh need to think about that because I would be surprised now you know you mentioned that Gman might change the estimated the change in September but you know that's about um that's only about I think seven weeks before the election I would be surprised at that uh I I wouldn't look for a lot of change this year myself okay no change we'll get to that let's go back to your original Point here you know that some argue that this reported growth is just an illusion created by the inflation number in a lot of ways it is while the GDP growth is positive isn't it possible that growth is not tra translating to the real Improvement for everyday consumers here well no question about that because you know last year was just the government putting money in this year they're not putting as much in so you're not getting that push from it and then if you look at just look at look at the look at retail just use that as an example look at Macy's look at Target look at Walmart look at McDonald's I could just go down the list you know their businesses down targets down three quarters in a row I mean there's a lot of reasons for this one is that the consumer is pretty much full up on what they can do they just can't do a lot more and you know they borrowed up a lot car payments are up a lot insurance way up and so they it squeezed them to the point to where that segment which is half of the country is really in a hurt right now and I think the the upper 15 or 20% doesn't realize it they don't think as much about it but that's that's what's going on in the country yeah there seems to be such a Divergent just before coming on the air we were talking about as I was prepping for this interview and watching your talk with Jim Bianco we had him on our show not long ago and he tweeted about the FED needing to do an emergency rate cut because there's Palm Beach housekeepers that are making 150,000 a year and you can't find them so I'm wondering you know what's the Divergent here what's the real picture what are we really dealing with well I think a lot of the elite affluent at that level don't really have a clue is what's going on in the country I mean I hate to say it but they don't they don't do anything for the world a lot of ways and they're trying to find probably a housekeeper that can be a a home manager as well as a housekeeper and I don't think that's indicative of the US whatsoever I I mean I I I go all over the country so I see quite a bit of this and and I love housekeepers and and I I've had the greatest in my whole life but the point is is that I think that's I think Jim was uh tongue and cheek knowing him well as I do and uh you know it's interesting to see but he made I think he was trying to throw something out there to all the people that that think your rates won't you know won't come that won't come down they think they're coming down he thinks they're not yeah yeah well let's get to that and let's get your take I mean as I mentioned Goldman Sachs and other analysts are predicting first and maybe September there's a lot saying December some on the none at all fence I mean you know Ted I started the broadcast back in January pricing in six to seven Cuts so it has been quite crazy but could these expected Cuts possibly improve the sentiment here and give a more positive outlook and and if so how can investors prepare to take advantage of the potential changes well you know Jeremy they'll take it as a trade and just think about it like this if if the FED funds ratees five and a half how many times you think they'll cut before election time my guess is if they did anything it would be one which would make it five and a quarter but let's just say they do two which would put you at 5% and normally your 90-day treasury is going to trade up close to that you know say 20 or 30 basis points away from that it would be hard for us at least to go out and say we want to buy the 20 or 30-year bond with the idea that they're going to move a half a point or two quarters when I can get that much you know in the 90day OR six-month treasury as a trade that doesn't make any sense to us I think you'll get uh if they break you know drop them off you'll have people trade that but it'll just be it'll be Emeral they'll last one or two days and it's gone away because it really shouldn't affect what's really going on out there yeah there's been so much volatility obviously in the markets this year too we've seen all-time highs in many different asset classes but you know this whole strategy of sell and may go away it's been fairly popular historically I'm curious you know looking at today's market we see these highs subsequent volatility this year uh do you think that this is still an approach maybe it's a relevant here what are you advising investors well Jeremy it depends on how long you've been around I've seen some Summers where you know the markets didn't do well at all and I've seen someone they did really well it usually has to do with what you gained that point in the year I I remember in 87 we did a study uh the markets were up something like 20% by June and we did a study to see what our chances were of the markets being up 30% by the end of the year they were quite low and influenced us to take cash off the table here I think that it's a not that I don't I think it's a situation where things are really overpriced and people are just complacent they don't care you know they're going to go away and then if something happens while they're gone then they'll show back up and uh you know get fearful again yeah it's funny I mean we talk to a lot of people that say that there's a bubble and it's happening in front of our eyes and you know with the strong strong job numbers and resilient and consumer spinning is there a possibility for ongoing strength here in the market throughout the summer do you think well I'm sure there is but if you look at multiples right now on the S&P year 27 times you don't start super bow markets from 27 times and if you look at the cyclically adjusted the cape ratio it's about 34 the price to sales is right at three times sales 2.8 or 2.9 on the S&P you don't buy companies like that make any money the only reason the markets are up is because of basically you know four or five stocks I mean Nvidia was you know something like 25% of the whole move and so you it's in one the situations where I think the average Inver investor has no clue of how markets are situated as far as how companies inside the S&P are situated you know if you look at the other 495 companies um they're they're they're barely pulling the weight yeah is anything surprise you here Ted when you look at the kind of numbers that we're seeing in terms of you know the consumer spending in the future don't you think that wage growth isn't keeping Pace with inflation on this front I don't think it is no Jeremy I I don't believe it is because if you see it you know normally consumers at certain points you know graduation Christmas Thanksgiving you know you'll see them do anything they can to really you know push those consumer numbers U and what we've seen now though I think this is a difference now is that if you look at their insurance cost cars Insurance costs on homes their taxes on their homes you look at what they're having to pay 22 and a qu% on credit cards and the delinquency people blow this off but you need to watch it the delinquency rates on auto payments and credit cards has really turned a lot in the last last year is it where it was at one time uh during Co no but that's an anomaly that's a onetime and 50-year deal you can't really use that and so I I think people have to wake up as to what's really going on I mean I know a lot of people in in the apartment business and they're getting some drags people slow pay yeah okay give me your forecast here for the end of the year I mean you know given the potential of interest rate cuts the ongoing inflation that we're seeing uh what strategies are you advising investors here Ted who want to keep their portfolios balanced and resilient but still you know a bit of an Roi you know uh Jeremy when it comes to forecast we're not really really good at it because nobody ever knows and so I try not to forecast but I will tell you what we're doing and I think that's more important uh if you look at where we are today we still on on all three strategies which is uh conservative income High income and then stock strategy and all of those overall we have between 40 and 52% in short-term treasuries Now by that I mean somewhere between a year or list but a lot of it is floating on the 90day rate that tells you a little bit about what we're thinking right now you know our different allocations than we've had last year we have obviously last year we had a lot of more gold more gold miners we added more energy we've always owned the pipelines we still do those are something we don't usually sell at any time and if you look at the Common Stocks that we' picked up we've done a lot of consumer staples you'll see where you know we we bought you know McDonald's and Kimberly Clark unit lever those kinds of companies that do well when times are are just not that great and do we own the Legacy tech stocks we always own yes we do but less of them we've sold those at probably four or five times over the years and um we feel really good about what we own and if we were not markets were to break and we thought there was a better risk reward than the 5.2 I'm getting in the in the floater uh we would move on it but we we we see a lot of stocks we you know we basically run about a 250 stock screen we don't have that many stocks that are just really really cheap right now yeah no valuations are quite High I mean you talked a little bit about those high yield Investments they come with higher risks especially in volatile sectors like Tech and Renewables I'm curious you know how do investors ensure that they're not Overexposed here Ted you mention that you were taking a bit of profit here well we it depends on what it is Jeremy as an example we have have had a lot of energy we're we're overweight energy coming out of last year and through the year last year and all we did there was let's say your total energy was 10% and you go to two it's not like you're not in the game now when it comes to income side of energy we own the pipelines and we have some great pipelines we don't sell those most of those are tax advantaged and we don't have any reason to sell them I can make the case today that a pipeline on a K1 is a better investment today than commercial real estate or even even apartment real estate right now because I can get seven and a half to 8% on the cash flow and I and it's solid you know it's always there on the other side of the stock side you know I'll give you an idea about what you trade you know we owned last year to cheap prices United Health we bought it owned it a long time um but it got up pretty high we took some off we added some back when it fell back again then it got overvalued here for us at least in the last two or three weeks and we sold most of it you know but we go to we we move forward and go to something else you know it's not like we're trying to trade the market every day or something like that we shoot for longterm capital gains and I will tell you most of ours are longterm yeah and it's a good strategy too uh rewind a little bit tell me a little bit more on the equity side on energy plays too I mean obviously we see the price of oil down today but I'm curious for that long term uh retail consumers probably going to come back into the market because they realize that you know it's not going away anytime soon we're still depending on this stuff you know you have to think about oil like this and if you look at and I'm and by the way I've traded oil companies all the way back to 1980 but if you look at if you look at oil companies they they're not like something you can buy and just hold it for 20 years they they they have periods of outperformance and it might be five years it might be eight years there's a number now I happen to think they're going to do really well this decade because I think people have misjudged the green EV look here I I think they misjudged that quite a bit uh not that I'm against that or anything like that I'm I'm obviously a conservationist but my point is is that if you own situations where and we we feel like we've owned the best I mean we own Exxon we own Williams Brothers we you know we own uh a lot of pipelines mlx we own an Enterprise product like I go down the list that we have but sometimes sometimes some of the producers not the Pipelines some of the producers get a little bit extended and you you you can look at it and say well that's not the time we'll put any new money into that and oil will you have to be careful with it a little bit because it will throw you off I remember 1977 oil went up the market went down all year and market and oil went up all year yeah so it depends on what you know what's happening but but I think there's POS everybody shut on some energy now um if you're biased against because climate Etc understand that I'm not trying to convince you but uh the main point is we think it has a lot of upside to it over over the next five over the next five years mostly cyclical as we see in that commodity space too I've certainly known a lot of people that have had their Heyday in oil and gas and then have ended up without a job for a year or two too uh talk to me a little bit about Utilities in terms of you know some of this safe money that we weren't looking for before uh this the start of this year seems to to be great bets is there any equities on that side well we own a couple of utilities and um Entergy and in public service but we but uh we we are not you know there's two or three of the utilities that are really getting a big play off of AI right and we don't chase things like that they don't we look for companies that we think okay they can pay that cash flow for a long long time and increase it I think the utilities will be uh better than people expect because we are going to put some major pressure on our electric grid and if we don't come up and I and see I tie that in with energy you can't you you there's no way I mean if you look at this Administration that just came out and said hey uh no no no no more LG we're not going to let you have any more ferments on that and well by the way you know the next two years no coal plant you have to get rid of your coal plants for for electricity and then right behind that we're going to do natural gas well you know how much that is of electric probably 40% on the market I'm like you can't cut out all electricity just because you want to say hey I love green peas I'm not I'm yeah that won't work in the world you have to get something that's pragmatic and make if you're going to make it work get a plan and and make it work the right way yeah especially while everybody's using more on their technology these days it requires a lot more power uh okay well it's interesting because talk to me a little bit about the debt markets I mean there's a concern that the debt markets might not react as expected due to an already low interest interest environment but how should investors navigate this in terms of limited returns you know traditional jet Investments what are you looking at here Jeremy could I say one thing before we go on about the energy and I'll be happy to answer that yeah love it if people are so hung up on AI right now why don't you go use some AI to figure out what the electricity oil and gas situation is going to look like over the next three or four or five years and then come back to me you know that that would be my answer secondly but on the debt side I think your question if you'll re Reas it I I'm not certain certain what I got there you know what I I want to go back there because I think that that was more important to talk about because there's a lot of people that talk about the AI Community using it you know power in the grid what it's going to take uh over this next 3 four years you think that's the oil and gas play because there's a lot of talk about uranium you know small modular reactors some some some other sources of electricity that are needed here but they're not overnight it's not going to be been running tomorrow well I know people that are in the you know in the in the small nuclear thing trying to get it to make it a corporation kind of thing where corporations can have that and that and that's all well and good the problem is is that if you look at if you look at what it takes to make solar what it takes to make wind energy is a major major component of that and when I said AI if AI is so good why don't we use it to determine how we're going to work through through all in other words you got to break it back against itself say hey I'm the big user but I'm the smartest person in the room AI so tell me what this supposed to look like the next five to seven years see it's ironic I think in a way but that's what the way I look at it from time to time yeah uh okay talk to me quickly before I let you go here Ted just about we we referenced really quickly that we're going to be seeing some elections this year I mean United States isn't the only country there's quite a few in the G7 at least I'm curious you know policy I know the FED wants to be a little different here but what are your top things that you're looking for going into it is it things like debt do you mean uh government debt how are we going to do that well uh jerman that's a great question if you had that answer then I would I would hire you for sure um the point is uh we really don't have a good answer for the problem we're running into is they're not buying the bonds overseas any they're they have the same amount they've had for about six or seven years that's so all the buying has come from ourselves you see so we're buying pension plans we're buying you know States buy fed buys their own bonds you know individuals own a lot of money markets Etc the problem with all that is is that you do get in a situation after a while so you're using so much of the money you create in the country to buy your own bonds that you start you start getting in a situation where the old crowding out that learn in business school that's what that is in other words you don't have enough money to run the machine and I think over the next five years or so I think you're going to really come to the point to where I hate to say it but I think there will be a a point to where they have to really get down and do something because there'll be some real problems yeah yeah has America changed its stance here in the global take I mean think about the Emerging Markets a lot of people are looking towards them right now and that's where they're placing their bats well that's not a that's not probably a bad idea in some ways I think I think Americans need to think a little bit about this and you know I'm I'm as pro-american I'm an US Army veteran don't don't get me wrong I'm I weigh the flag but here's the problem if you look at Pax Americana which is US leading the world that's that's not here okay we're we right now we have if you look at natural resource group top four natural resource countries Russia Number One China number four we're number two okay Canada isn't right in there number three behind us but here's the point we're playing this game of wanting to be number one in the world when we're really not we don't have the military power there's a lot of things and yet we're acting out as if we do which means that somewhere along the line you get into trouble because instead of being a unipolar were anymore you're a multi-polar world I mean and look at all the people that really don't want to do business with us and you can keep you can keep throwing sanctions on people but it comes back to harm you in the long run you know Trump did it Biden's done it and those don't work uh in the long long run and I think I think where people mess up is not realizing we're in a wh situation right now and that could have some effects on the US economy yeah absolutely I mean you saw with President Biden just meeting some leaders of Africa you're starting to see some investment into that region almost as if oh wow I was a little too late to this so I'm curious to see this next little while where it evolves in the world Community well it it it's getting stickier Jeremy all the time I mean you look at you look at relations between Russia and the US China and the US to a certain degree India and the us but certainly Saudi in the US some of the South American countries and I'm I'm just looking at from from the standpoint of you know if I'm looking at buying a company I want to know where they do business um and I think some of the ways we've we've gone about this with those foreign countries has turned them the other way in other words they want to get away from the dollar that's that means they're going toward gold they're going toward medals they're doing other things to get away from the US dollar yeah yeah and what do you think Ted I mean I could talk to you forever here but what do you think about the policy work when you know in the US the government says okay you cannot get the resour ources out of the ground but I'll go to Africa and we'll invest there and we'll take them from that region like What's Happening Here well on the energy policy I think we're in a big hypocritical policy I mean it's you know I I it's interesting to me we we have the capacity to produce a lot I mean and and and by the way oh you know over the next 50 years energy is going to decline obviously you know everybody knows that it's just a timing factor is how you going to do it over time and I think to harm the American people who buy gasoline uh because you want to say hey I'm a different way and we want to make you know be the world leader in green that's okay it's just your timing's off and so you get what'll happen is you'll get people into an inflationary situation with with energy you know yeah yeah and we've certainly seen it on the cost front uh that's all the time we have but Ted Oakley managing partner and founder of Oxo advisor joining us again on pack all this hey thank you sir I appreciate your time as always and I'm looking forward to coming uh coming having you back on the show maybe Q2 we can talk a little bit about this in review Jeremy always appreciate it thank you appreciate it Ted thanks so much [Music]

hey everyone I'm Jeremy saffron this is Kiko news if you haven't already don't forget to hit that subscribe button for the latest and today on the show we're talking about the big moves in Precious Metals gold prices have hit new record highs driven by us China trade tensions increased seasonal demand from India and an improved US inflation Outlook now with prices now above $2,400 per ounce on the spot Side gold is attracting attention is a safe haven like never before central banks and Emerging Markets are also buying up gold to protect against economic and geopolitical risks and as we turn over to Silver that metal price is also Making Waves driven by strong industrial demand uh especially from India's solar energy sector India imported more silver in the first quarter of 2024 than in all of last year pushing prices past the $30 per ounce Mark analysts are even speculating about a potential short squeeze that could drive prices higher so what does this mean for investors and how can we navigate these markets and make the most out of them well to break it all down we're joined by our friend Adam Rosen schwag managing partner at go ring in Rosen schwag Adam welcome to Kingo thank you so much for having me happy to be here today yeah I appreciate your time and as we mentioned briefly I got a little bit of a cold going so thanks for bearing with my voice uh let's turn over to Gold let's start with that obviously prices have recently surged to new record highs driven by a combination of factors as I just mentioned in the intro but with analysts predicting further price increases what do you think are the key factors at sustaining this rally and Adam how high could gold prices go well you know it's it's a really interesting question I think we are in the early Innings here of a very prolonged and substantial gold bull market and ultimately I think that prices could get you know really out of control how high could they ultimately get I think if you look at long-term historical averages of different Financial metrics relative to the gold price you know you could make a case for5 67,000 gold you can make a case if it gets radically overvalued for over $110,000 gold I know that sounds outlandish but there's been several times over the last 120 years where every dollar of uh US currency has been backed by a140 worth of gold if you did that math today based on how much money's outstanding the numbers are huge but I don't think that necessarily happens um you know in the short term I think that's sort of our longer term price Target what I think you're starting to see happen now and what's driving the gold price today uh is really Central Bank buying it's Central Bank buying from all around the world over the last 18 to 24 months we've seen central banks buy well over a thousand tons of gold that's the fastest pace of accumulation we have seen um since we've gone off the gold standard in in 1971 or the brenon Wood standard so that's really what's been driving things uh so far has been the central banks and we could talk about all the reasons why we think that might be happening yeah well I mean you know if central banks begin offloading their gold reserves could this lead to a significant Market volatility is there any mechanisms that are in place to mitigate those risks kind of like 2008 so I think that the short answer is no central banks are free to do what it is they would like but I don't think that we will see Central Bank liquidation anytime soon in fact I think we're actually going to see quite a bit more Central Bank accumulation so the way that we think about it is that until we see any evidence to the contrary I think um this trend is going to continue in terms of the Central Bank accumulation why do I say that well if you go back over about 150 years 170 years of studying commodity markets every time that real assets get really really really cheap relative to financial assets and all we're doing there is we're taking the commodity price and we're dividing it by the Dow Jones that's the longest running um stock index that that we have uh when you get these periods where commodity prices or real assets in general become super dislocated what you often get believe it or not is a change in the global monetary system um that happened in 29 when we went off the classical gold standard the next time it got that cheap was in 69 when the US dollar went off gold then the next time it happened was in 99 and that's the time when uh all the Asian currencies pegged their currency to the US dollar at this below average rate to Spur their exports so we're in the right zip code for Central Bank upheaval right now and that's what I think is so important and so when we started to to see the central banks buying gold about 18 months ago that didn't surprise us because we're in the right neighborhood or the right zip code as they say here in the states uh to see monetary regime change and I think that's exactly what we're seeing now so until there's evidence to the contrary I think we continue down that path okay I mean you know we talk about the FED probably implementing some rate Cuts here a lot of people talking about gold prices exceeding 3,000 I mean you just said possibly 5 to 10 obviously looking at longterm but what econ repercussions could such a rise have I mean do you see this leading to a fundamental shift like you just mentioned unpack this a little bit even a new gold standard here I I I think we I think the outcome of this is completely uh unknowable but I think that in any case gold ends up taking on more of a monetary role than it has at any point since 1970 um I don't think it's likely that we go back on a global gold standard for several reasons first of all it's incredibly inflexible and second of all the price of gold that would be necessary uh to effectively monetize the world uh would have to be so so so high so I suppose it's possible but I don't think that's the base case gold is simply too scarce in an economy of this size uh instead what I think today the most likely outcome would be and and you know like Keen said I I reserve the right to change my mind if I see the facts changing but what looks most likely as of today um is a trading block likely centered on the so-called bricks countries that are trying to get away from transacting bilateral trade in US dollars so right now the quintessential example that we like to use if Australia sells coal to China it's priced in US Dollars it's not priced in rimi and it's not priced in aie dollars and in fact 90 plus percent of global trade is like that and and there's a big big big Push by several countries notably the so-called bricks so Brazil China uh India to a certain extent to begin to move away from the US dollar uh and use a different currency so right now the currency where most of these trades are happening and and you are getting quite a bit of for instance trade between Brazil and China that's all priced in reimi however in that world the reimi is not convertible so you all of a sudden if you're a Brazilian iron or exporter you end up with all this excess ramim and what do you do if you have the excess dollars you could go to London and buy a nice townhouse in belgrave at a villa in the south of France but if you're stuck with rimi what do you want to do you know you're not going to buy a second home in chenu uh so what's looking more and more likely is that you'll begin to repatriate that money back by exchanging it for gold at the Shanghai Gold Exchange and that seems to be what's happening today so as of today it remains an open question that would be my best guess for an alternative monetary block to try to rival the US dollar doesn't happen overnight uh I don't think it necessarily means the demise of the US dollar fact you know when the US went off gold in 71 it became more and more relevant not less so so who knows what the future holds but I think gold plays more of a role going forward and that's why it's catching a bid today yeah and you know you mentioned Adam I mean with the ongoing dollarization efforts where countries are conducting more tradeing currencies other than the US dollar uh how do you see the trend in the long term here affecting the prices could this be a long-term Catalyst that wasn't necessarily there before absolutely I think it certainly will be and again you know it might sound like a like a crazy Black Swan thing to say but in fact this is basically what we see every time that hard assets become super cheap relative to paper assets and why is that I don't think it's a coincidence I think what ends up happening is that in the periods of time when when real asset prices and commodity prices become so cheap and speculative Financial assets whether it's the radio stocks in the 20s or the conglomerate boom in the 60s coms in the 2000s or you know Bitcoin and and non-fungible tokens uh in this cycle whatever it is as these completely intangible assets get bit up and real assets become cheap the central banks have a little more cover to run looser policy for longer and they get themselves into trouble and the first time we had quantitative easing was actually in the mid 20s 1920s not 2020s and at the end it just goes too far and so you get this realignment so I do think that we're in that again what I call the right zip code for a major realignment um I think he could have made the argument 10 years ago that we were as well except there was no evidence it was happening we didn't see people moving away from the dollar we're seeing it now and so until see otherwise I think that's going to continue is that a catalyst that's a huge Catalyst not unlike what we saw in the early 1970s and the late 1990s so major major major shifts that took place there and I think we'll we're seeing another one today yeah and I mean as you mentioned it's kind of a cyclical approach in the ities I mean we certainly see it when ETFs and the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved the inflows it almost is the flavor of the day but does this create a bubble similar to The Dot or housing Bubbles and more specifically what indicators should investors watch for to avoid being caught in a potential gold market bubble so the answer is it definitely does run the potential and and just like every commodity cycle that's gone before it I think this one will end with investor Euphoria and huge amounts of money pouring into the space and ultimately being invested in new projects and bringing on too much capacity at the wrong period of time um you know people talk about how the gold producers or the oil producers have sort of found discipline or found religion I don't think any of that's true I think by the time this is all said and done it'll be a bubble no less however what's important is that we are so far away from that today and you talked about ETFs and I think that's a really great point you know with gold making an all-time high you might think that the ETFs were just piling up on gold left right and center but actually the ETFs which I would call the speculative demand for gold right that's how most western speculators like to swing around gold pricing today or gold Investments today certainly the hedge funds you know that was at um 94 uh what is this million uh ounces back in uh June of last year and today it's down to 80 in fact since the beginning of the year it's shed uh 6 million uh ounces and it continues so we haven't you know you would be hardpressed to look at the chart of the ETF Holdings of gold and tell me where you had a new all-time high similarly if you want to talk about people that have no investment interest at all forget gold prices and look at the Gold stocks those are nowhere near bubble territories you know we there we've seen you know 10% uh uh sell off not selloff rather but but liquidation of 10% of the shares in the various GDX uh ETF in the last three weeks alone so you know we're nowhere near bubble territory these companies are trading at half times nav and four times earnings that's not where great bubbles end nor is it with um gold backing the various Fiat currencies at such a low rate as it is today so it definitely will end badly just like it always does probably 10 years from now with gold fivefold where it is today and gold stocks being the best asset class of the coming years I suspect okay of the coming years let's break that down I mean is this the year of gold stocks we've seen the Divergence obviously it hasn't really caught up to the metal prices but you know looking towards it is this going to be the next play I mean you know silver we're going to get into in a moment it's finally starting to catch up a little bit uh is this decoupled or are we going to start to see some nice movements on the on the equity side I think we will and you know I you have to know what you're good at and what you're less good at and and we're pretty good at at getting the big fundamental drivers right I'm not particularly great at Market timing in fact I tend to be early on a lot of the things that we do so is this the year I sure hope so we're positioning ourselves accordingly we've been adding to our gold Investments here and I think that the time is getting closer day by day and I think it could certainly be it as far as whether gold stocks have permanently decoupled and things like that you know I don't think that that's really the case um you back last cycle there was a moment where gold popped higher and the gold stocks kind of lagged and that was because the GLD was introduced as a new instrument and that attracted the kind of incremental investor dollar not necessarily towards the gold stocks but actually in the last seven or eight years gold stocks have done what they ought to do in the sense that when gold goes up they go up with even more leverage uh the only time that that's kind of decoupled has been in the last 18 months or so and I think the answer is actually fairly straightforward over the last two years years we've had a real rate hike cycle in the west and Western investors and speculators have been conditioned to do one thing in the face of real rising Rising real rates and that is sell everything gold and again you can see it super clearly when you look at the Holdings of the ETFs either the GLD or the GDX which is the shares or the glds which is the you know physical metal Western speculators have been shedding everything and the central banks and predominant the eastern central banks have been the ones doing the buying again because potentially they're setting up this alternative currency block potentially they're getting worried about how the US is weaponizing the dollar or just the fact that you know War seems to be spreading now on a global basis whatever the reasons may be but while they're buying gold bars hand over fist one thing they don't buy are gold shares so in the west you have the speculators selling gold bars and gold shares and in the rest of the world they're buying the gold bars but the stocks are gone no bid so we see a huge opportunity I don't think that's decoupling at all in fact I think when the Western Speculator begins to come back to the gold market that will play a huge catch-up rally and close that Gap the question of course like always is when yeah a lot of people happy to hear that one uh as you mentioned there's a noticeable Divergence in Gold investment behaviors between eastern and western markets and you know it's a crazy year we have a lot of uh countries in the G7 Nations going into elections you have one in the US how should Western investors and policy makers respond to the shift here in your view well as far as policy makers Go I mean you know the dysfunction and the turmoil that's now spreading around the world uh you know is I wouldn't dare to say what I would expect policy makers to do but I think in general investors and policy makers uh need to be I think a little bit more aware of the tail risk of major changes again you know if we had talked 10 or 15 years ago when real asset prices for instance were really expensive relative to financial assets and you said oh the dollar Reserve currency uh is at risk I would say well it's a kind of a strange time for that to happen historically going back hundreds of years you get these big kind of systemic changes when you seem to really dislocate the price of real assets relative to paper ones and that's where we are today so I think leaving yourself open to the possibility of that Black Swan event that tail risk where something different actually uh lurks on the other side is very very important what does it mean to the average person well the average person and the average kit coat listener might not be exactly the same but I think it means you know making sure that you're well Diversified and have a healthy allocation to gold and whether it's to Gold Boolean or to Gold shares I think you'll do better you'll do both well with both it's really a question of your risk tolerance uh let's talk silver uh it's been on a significant rise on the price side nearly 25% obviously driven by strong indust Ral demand from sectors like EVS which you've talked about and solar energy considering India's substantial increase in silver Imports to the solar buildout do you think silver could become as important as gold in the investment World here you know it's interesting silver has always been what they call the the poor men's gold obviously you can make a um ounce investment for a substantially lower price uh and people have often wondered whether or not that would change now that you can buy so-called electronic gold whether the GLD or other vehicles where you could effectively put $25 into a gold investment just like you could into an ounce of silver if you so chose you know I look I think the jury's still out I think that silver today continues to act as a quote unquote Poor Man's gold and there's often a view which I think is is fascinating and and my colleague and partner Lee Garing has done a lot of work on but there's this view always that uh to have a strong precious metals rally silver has to outperform and that's not exactly true what does tend to happen is that silver tends to lag gold and lag gold and lag gold throughout the rally and then it stages this massive Furious catchup so that by the end of the cycle they've both gone up you know comparable amount but everyone it kind of sticks in everyone's mind this huge silver surge because it happens in this compressed time right at the very end and that's actually when you do get that massive catchup rally that's not necessarily the best um indicator for uh precious metals either gold or silver it actually tends to be a preceding a period of consolidation in both and the last time we got that was back in 2020 and 2021 when the Reddit crowd tried to quarter the silver market in what was it January of 2021 and ultimately failed you had this huge catch-up rally in silver leading into that and then ultimately that spelled uh sort of pause in the gold and silver bull market for the next really three years or so so um we're not seeing that yet yes silver has done nicely here but it's still undervalued relative to gold and I suspect just like in past Cycles it'll lag and then stage some massive Furious catchup uh and right now we would favor gold over silver oh interesting okay I mean there's speculations about a potential short squeeze in the silver Market that could push prices you know towards 50 bucks and SS how realistic is this scenario Adam and and who stands to gain or lose the most if it happens potential short squeezes in the silver market have been a thing of rumor for many many years there's been a lot of different views on that trading desks like at JP Morgan and what have you um you know I have never subscribed to those views we're gold bulls today uh and and you know positive on on Silver although I would prefer gold if I given the choice uh but we're not gold bugs and we don't necessarily um subscribe to some of the more colorful theories that some of the community puts out there and I think that was given a good test uh with that Reddit squeeze where you know if in fact that big financial institution short squeeze and silver was present you probably would have seen um the capitulation there but you didn't you know last a couple days and then it came right back off again so I don't know it's hard to say like you said there's a little bit more industrial underpinning today might be a little bit more real but I I don't think that that's in uh particularly likely um here yeah I mean you've been bullish on uranium looking at the other Commodities here obviously there's a critical role in global energy strategies here there's a push for the carbon free power sources particularly in China and Indian but how do you see the role of uranium evolving in the energy mix and and give me your outlook here uranium I think is one of the most fascinating commodity markets out there for a couple of different reasons which we can get into um it's not you know an uncovered uh story anymore it's now kind of come to the light but I think that the rally continues to have legs and I think we'll see uranium prices move higher from here we're maintaining our uranium positions in a couple cases we've trimmed a little bit just on some real strength but it remains a core position I for us uranium producing equities and development companies remains a core position in our portfolios and I think what's really fascinating about the uranium Market is that for the first time since we've split the atom we now have a structural uranium deficit that might sound like a crazy thing to say but throughout most of the 60s and 70s as nuclear power proliferated actually uranium mines proliferated even faster we had a few speculative high-tech uranium mining booms throughout that period of time um and so we always had more uranium than we had reactor demand and the and the Surplus was always bought up by governments to basically try to prevent other governments from um buying uranium to with which to make weapons uh by the early 80s finally the Soviets said look this is ridiculous we have way too much uranium here and we're kind of going broke how about we reclassify some of this government stockpiles into commercial stock piles and sell it into the reactor uh markets and in fact we can then also tell the world that we're you know de weaponizing and um what they called the megga tons to megawatts project and that was successful in providing tons into the market uranium prices collapsed because of it through the 80s and 90s total uranium mine Supply fell by nearly 50% and it was all made up for by the stockpiles the stockpiles ran out in the early 2000s uranium went up tfold and then Fukushima happened and with Fukushima we replaced the government stockpiles with commercial stockpiles because 30% of the reactors went offline right and we still produced uranium with which to power them and so those found themselves in these big commercial stockpiles those stockpiles ran out in 2022 so for the first time with no exaggeration for the first time since the Manhattan Project for the first time since the atom was split we now have a structural and primary uranium shortfall and it will only be closed by bringing on new mind Supply because a nuclear reactor can withstand two three $400 uranium prices and not impair the economics so there's no demand destruction to come it's really tricky to bring on production in the short order existing producers whether it's Kaza prom or Cho seem to be challenged nextg is the next one Everyone's Watching but I think that that timeline is a little bit aggressive to and so it's going to have to be price to squeeze it out but that's going to be a difficult difficult task and so I think it's a very interesting Market based on today's fundamentals to say nothing of the future increase in nuclear power going forward yeah it's wild I mean you talk about it we had the destigmatization of it where people realize that we're going to need this in the mix especially in an AI World in this technology Evolution uh we're going to need uh in we're going to need nuclear power so I'm kind of curious here is it it The Perfect Storm and is it going to happen this year are we going to see this happen again like a cyclical approach I mean the next year or two is looking to be interesting it's looking to be very interesting again because a lot of it you know you don't want to say things are set in stone but I get a question all the time well when is the new when are the new nuclear reactors coming online to really tighten this market and I said guys you don't understand what's happened here in this market what you're seeing is um Market that's been in deficit for three or four years masked by a one-time inventory overhang and the inventories are now eroded so that's what people have yet to understand you know we're not talking about small modular reactors we're not talking about AI demand we're not talking about um a reshift away from Renewables towards nuclear to solve our climate goals we're just talking on what's happening today and that's what's so dramatic is that um is that what's happening today has been asked and it's and it's now coming to light so uranium prices bottomed at 19 bucks back in 201819 you know they're flirting with $100 today where do they go I don't know you can't bring on material in the short term for $200 you can't bring it on for 300 so I think that we could have a really what we call a violent move to the upside um and and a very frenetic and chaotic move as well and is that going to happen over the next couple of years you think here Adam I mean we see a lot of these miners going to old properties in America we saw the ban of uranium with Russia it seems again Perfect Storm and it should be probably short term I suspect it will be throughout this year next year and the year after and then ultimately we like to look for these what we call these kind of off-ramps to the bull market so even though we take really long-term views we like to stress test ourselves by saying what will ultimately derail this and it will be new Supply eventually um given $150 uranium prices longterm you can bring on new minds with enough time but it's going to take some time and I think it'll be from now to the end of the decade will be a very very exciting period for Uranium yeah well said Adam Rosen schwag managing partner at ging and Rosen schwag joining us to break it all down from New York uh thanks for coming on this was great Adam I really appreciate your time today oh thanks for having me really enjoyed it as well yeah we'll speak soon and for all of you at home I'm Jeremy saffron uh for all of us here at

this is about as big as when Nixon closed the gold window I mean it was a she announced a change to the system she just threw the last 40 Years of economic Orthodox in this country in the trash and I think it's super important this in my opinion was the fed's error this time around right the FED always makes new errors they learn from their mistakes they just make new mistakes or versions of the same mistake who cares what I'm telling you what Janet yellen's telling you what Jake Sullivan's telling you what the Department of Defense is telling you is that it's a national security interest of the US to get out of the treasury export business uh gold would have to go up 19x to match the price level it was at in 1980 relative to foreign held treasuries outstanding every single thing in macro is telling you what going to keep going higher you're seeing yelling throw 40 Years of economic Orthodoxy in the trash the $130 trillion bond market is the sucker at the card table and it's going to figure that out on the spot with Michelle mccy is brought to you by Swan Bitcoin hello I'm Michelle mccy thank you for joining us again billionaires Jamie Diamond and Ray doio are again sounding the alarm on the soaring US Government debt now at over $ 34.7 trillion JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Diamond is stressing the need for the US government to reduce its budget deficit before financial markets force a reckoning in what he called a far more uncomfortable way than if dealt with from the start anre Delio the founder of Bridgewater the world's biggest hedge fund says that he's very worried about the declining investor appetite for government bonds diio told the financial times that he's concerned about the softening demand to meet Supply particularly from international buyers worried about the US debt picture and possible sanctions against countries other than Russia andalo most likely referring to sanctions on China this after US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that the US is prepared to sanction Chinese Banks and companies as well as beijing's leadership if they assist Russia's Armed Forces with their invasion of Ukraine and this all comes as China just sold a record amount of Treasury and US agency bonds Beijing offloaded a total of $53.3 billion worth of treasuries and agency bonds combined in the first quar water meanwhile China continues to buy gold well my next guest says that these are the latest signs that the dollar system as we know it is dying that the US treasury bond is losing its position as the world's primary Reserve asset but that the dollar will still remain the global Reserve currency Luke groman says the dollar will not be replaced but it will be repriced and lays out what this means for gold inflation and how Bitcoin fits into the picture Luke is one of the most respected names in the Global Research sector he's the founder and president of forest for the trees or fftt which Aggregates macroeconomic thematic and sector Trends in an unconventional manner to identify investable economic bottlenecks he's also the author of the Mr X interviews volumes one and two and Luke was also the founding partner of Cleveland research company and was a partner at Midwest research Luke thank you for joining us welcome to the show thanks sh Michelle it's great to be here so Luke your research really helps investors see the big picture see the forest for the trees if you will and I want you to help us understand this theory that you have of us treasuries losing their dominance as the global Reserve asset but despite this the dollar maintaining its Reserve status but before we zoom out I do want to get your shortterm view and you've said that the fed's real top mandate is that it will not allow treasury market dysfunction so expand on that and what your current macroeconomic Outlook is yeah my current macroeconomic Outlook is uh bullish for risk assets uh I'm negative on a real basis on long-term US Treasury bonds and and longterm Western sovereign debt more broadly long-term bonds more broadly uh bullish on Commodities bullish on gold bullish on bitcoin bullish on nominal growth in the US bullish on inflation in the US bullish on employment in the US and I think ultimately the easiest way to break that down is global central banks stopped buying US Treasury bonds 10 years ago on a net basis and US debt has not stopped growing and so there is uh and not only is it not stopped growing it's growing exponentially and so there's a widening gap between supply of US Treasury bonds and demand from Global Central Banks and that Gap is being filled by the global private sector uh and then when there we had run into periods where there is insufficient demand from the global private sector for those bonds which manifests as a stronger dollar and US Treasury Market dysfunction uh the FED and/or treasury inject dollar liquidity uh and they've done so multiple times at an accelerating Pace accelerating in intervals over the last four to five years and when they do so it's it's good for uh all the asset classes and nominal GDP and inflation and employment that I just mentioned and and I think what we're seeing increasingly are markets reflexively beginning to understand that treasury market dysfunction will not be allowed on a sustained basis in which case you've got a $130 trillion Global bond market increasingly squeezing into the $65 trillion Us doll equity Market the uh roughly $4 trillion gold market and the $1.4 trillion Bitcoin market and so when you look at charts of S&P 500 over the long Bond it is uh spiking when you look at the NASDAQ over the long Bond it is spiking uh gold over the long Bond spiking Bitcoin over the long Bond spiking all of these Spikes have happened in the last 18 to 24 months and I think those are signs of the market recognizing the bond Market starting to recognize that on a real basis it is the sucker at the card table the bubble is in long-term US Treasury bonds and the way that is resolved is by moving into things that will better hedge inflation and I think that's what we've been watching and we'll continue to see over the course of this year all right and again before we get into your bigger picture thesis you have said that the fed and the treasury will continue to supply whatever dollar liquidity is needed in in what form is this does this mean you're seeing successive rate Cuts does this mean you're seeing uh quantitative easing in what form do they inject this liquidity and and what would be the ramifications uh any any form in in emergencies we've seen it injected as QE right so March 2020 uh the bond market uh the off the Run treasury market crashes at the bottom of covid rates start going up rapidly and the FED comes in with very large L QE uh you can see it in other ways they also shortly thereafter uh Exempted US Treasury bonds from SLR or supplementary leverage regulations supplementary supplementary leverage ratios easy for me to say regulations for the banks that's just QE done through the banks uh you could see um it done as not QE when the problem was at the short end in when in the repo rate Spike of September 2019 the FED began growing their balance sheet insisted it was not QE it was liquidity uh we could see it again uh in the form of Treasury uh in 3 q22 fed continued to tighten but treasury ran down the treasury general account injecting dollar liquidity into the economy that more than offset the de the the tightening the Fed was doing with QT uh in 1 q23 they changed the Playbook again uh btfp in order to uh ostensibly assuage a banking crisis it wasn't banking crisis it was a treasury market dysfunction problem again that they were trying to stop from spreading uh more dollar liquidity uh second quarter of 23 they ran down the TGA again that was more about the debt ceiling than about any particularly acute problem in the Treasury Market Per Se uh 3 q23 once we had treasury market dysfunction we had the FED come out within 10day span seven different fed speakers all saying the bond market had done their job for them then we had treasur uh treasury follow that up uh about two weeks later in the quarterly refunding Announcement by yelling surprisingly shifting issuance from the long end to the short end of the curve and drawing down the reverse repo uh that the effects of what she did mimicked QE exactly but it was not QE according to purists markets reacted like it was QE markets don't care liquidity is liquidity uh first quarter of this year we've once again seen after the latest quarterly refunding announcement treasury didn't change their duration issuance but the FED cut their duration duration issuance right uh QT was was was cut back and so the amount of duration issuance in total between fed and treasury was once again cut so there's a lot of different ways to do this I tip my cap to them they keep uh switching it around as so as to not make it obvious uh they are talking right now there's an article this week in the Wall Street Journal about changing Basel banking regulation as soon as August people should read that as more dollar liquidity uh last week there was a two weeks ago there was an article in the Wall Street Journal talking about Freddy Mack uh using its balance sheet capacity to guarantee second mortgages in other words Freddy Mack could get into the business of guaranteeing vacations and pools and decks and consumer spending that is effectively a basically just through through Freddy Mack uh no different than a stimi that was handed out to everybody in co uh that could start as soon is tomorrow uh so there's a lot of different ways they're looking at and talking about doing this um and the purists will all say it's not monetizing the debt it's not QE blah blah blah markets are like Tommy Lee Jones and the fugitive when Richard Kimble's pointing his own gun at him I don't care so Luke we've got liquidity injected in Disguise or in various other ways but at the same time as you were running through the ways that the fed and the treasury were injecting liquidity into the markets we have the FED hiking rates now keeping them higher for longer at least so it seems so it's sort of negating the inflation fighting mandate if you will right it's like cutting your nose to spite your face you're saying you want inflation lower you're hiking rates to get there but you're aren't you negating all of those efforts by liquidity coming in through other means in the short run yes and in the long run paradoxically the fed's rate hikes are probably now adding to inflation uh in the initial stages in 2022 they were absolutely very the Fed rate hikes were absolutely very disinflationary to the private sector they arguably still are uh in terms of a lagged effect of the rate hikes the problem is is that there is nobody alive and operating in markets that was alive the last time the FED raised rates that fast when US debt to GDP was 120% of GDP uh and so this in my opinion was the fed's error this time around right the FED always makes new errors they learn from their mistakes they just make new mistakes or versions of the same mistake whatever initially Fed rate hikes were disinflationary to the private sector they probably we still are however as $35 trillion in debt is repriced higher interest expense for the US government goes up deficits go up and unless the US government slashes spending on the only other two line items big enough to cut to offset the increase in the deficit from interest expense which are defense and entitlements and we're not cutting either of those things they're both going up as well uh then you're going to have a much bigger deficit as a result of Fed rate hikes and deficits all else SQL are stimulative particularly when you have a Fed that refuses to allow High deficits to caused treasury dysfunction so if the Fed was willing to stand aside and let treasury auctions fail treasury dysfunction happen because the deficit is so big that it's crowding out Global dollar markets that there isn't enough balance sheet to finance us deficits without much higher rates then yes Fed rate hikes would be disinflationary they'd be they'd be deflationary but the fed's not allowing that treasury market dysfunction to to do that process and so what we're ending up with on a lag now is higher deficits because of interest expense and a shrinking private sector and or a disinflationary private sector it's not shrinking but it's disinflationary that's the same combination just a little bit more mild that we had during Co we had a huge deficits and we had a disrupted or slowing private sector and we know how that ended up it was extremely inflationary on a leg and I think now that we're uh over two years into Fed rate hikes I think we're starting to get on the bad side of that whole dynamic where government deficits against a disinflationary private side is adding to inflation SEC sequentially so uh they they're in a real pickle and and again unless they're willing to stand aside and let us def either slash entitlements slash defense to make room for the interest or if they're not going to slash those two then stand aside when the higher deficits cause treasury market dysfunction uh let treasury auctions fail which is never going to happen or let Banks fail without bailing out depositors over 250,000 which is never going to happen then it's going to continue to be inflationary um sequentially going forward in my view so if these rate hikes are in fact inflationary does it stand to reason that there's more likelihood that the FED will move to cut them I think there's a growing view there that you all credit on this deserves or belongs to Warren Mosler and and who's one of the one of the leading thinkers and theorists on the modern monetary Theory School they've gotten this whole rate hike cycle exactly right in terms of raising rates dramatically on 120% debt to GDP is going to add to deficits and ultimately unless you cut other things add to inflation um you saw Rick reer last week the CIO of fixed income at Black Rock talk about this that they need to cut rates to slow things down um yes and no right it we're going to get back to you know it will slow the deficit side but it's going to stimulate the private side and how do those two things net out um we're very much in a US Latin American problem us with Latin American characteristics problem Brazil Argentina Etc we have a fiscal problem the mistake the FED made was not letting inflation run hot enough for long enough to get that the GDP down before they raised rates so aggressively which is the same mistake that some of these Latin American countries made in the late 90s and 2000s and we know how that worked out okay let's let's zoom out again and look at what this means for the treasury market as you've said the top Mandate of the FED is to maintain treasury market function but you're saying that there's declining demand for treasuries from central banks in from central banks but you've said that foreign private investors are poised to step in and overtake central banks from buying us treasuries for the first time on record so break that down for us yeah you've seen the global private sector buy uh treasuries uh they will be the biggest buyer of treasuries surpassing central banks soon if they're not already that has an asteris needs an asterisk which is to say the global private sector foreigners in total I should say own $8 trillion in treasuries uh roughly uh as long as the dollar is low enough and moving lower they will buy once they start to get squeezed in other words foreigners in addition to owning $8 trillion in treasuries own about another 122 trillion in other us do assets net but they also have about $13 trillion dollar in dollar denominated borrowing uh and then who knows how big the euro dollar market it's estimated at anywhere from 10 to $50 trillion uh the dollar borrowings and the euro dollar market represent rather large dollar shorts so as the dollar goes up the balance sheet and economies of the foreign buyers foreign owners and and prospective buyers of treasuries the balance sheet capacity starts to shrink uh the way to think about this is say we have aund trillion do Global GDP economy say it grows 6% omally per year so that's $6 trillion do of growth every year the US deficit is projected to be $2 trillion a year for the next 10 years assuming no recessions so the United States needs to borrow two trillion needs to borrow a third of global GDP growth just to finance itself as the US borrows a third of global GDP growth every year it's going to put upward pressure on the dollar we're going to crowd out Global dollar markets problem with that is as the dollar goes up the global economy slows that's a very wellestablished correlation so Global GDP growth goes from six to five now there's only five trillion of global GDP growth for $2 trillion doll in deficits and with slowing Joy GDP growth globally us tax receips are probably going to disappoint which means us issuance the death it's probably not going to be 2 trillion it's probably be 2 and A2 trillion so now you need to borrow 2 and A2 trillion on 5 trillion so now it's not 33% of the global GDP growth anually the United States government needs to borrow it's 50% and so the higher the dollar goes the faster that math flips and it is very nonlinear so at you know you don't even need to grow you don't even need a massive Global recession you just need a bit of a Slowdown such that nominal GDP globally only grows three on 100 trillion now you're looking at $3 trillion worth of global growth us deficit is probably closer to 3 trillion at that point us needs to borrow almost all of global growth just to finance itself dollar is going to go up fast and now foreigners again because they're short dollars the and long treasuries are going to sell treasuries to raise dollars so now you're going to have the three trillion the US government selling plus foreigners going to be selling some portion of their 8 trillion to finance themselves you can quickly see how this gets into a net effec supply problem uh for the US government and that's going to try create rates up dollar up treasury market dysfunction and that's the moment where If the Fed wants infl or deflation they have to say let rates go to seven let them go to 10 on the tenure we're going to force the US government to collapse we're going to force them to basically cut everything except the interest expense and there is zero chance that's going to happen and so what ends up happening and I think the Market's starting to recognize this is well before it gets that point fed or treasury will inject doll liquidity to make sure that foreigners have enough balance sheet to make to to finance this stuff without creating this debt spiral and as the market gets conditioned to this markets are forward-looking they're reflexive they'll start to see that you don't actually want to own the bonds you want to own the stocks you want to own gold you want to own Bitcoin you want to own Commodities because those are the things that are going to see inflation on a lag benefit from the dollar inflation as you repeatedly inject dollar liquidity to support the treasury market which is what we've been doing for five plus years now so I get that from an investment point of view why you would be looking at other assets but in terms of central banks because your thesis is that us treasuries no longer have the dominant position of the global Reserve asset for central banks now currently uh currently it's uh 58% uh the dollar share of global Reserves at 58% as of Q4 of 2023 according to the IMF now we just started this interview by saying how China is selling its uh us treasuries uh but beyond China what do you see happening with central banks to make the US treasury bond lose its position as king of the global Reserve Central Bank assets yeah I think the reason why the US Treasury Market is is losing it sh's primary Global Reserve asset um and we can see that since 2014 Global central banks have sold $400 billion of treasuries on net and they've bought $600 billion do worth of gold on net so from a marginal perspective uh for the last 10 years gold has uh central banks have bought gold and sold treasuries the reason I think this is happening is is is multiple number one uh for the reasons I just highlighted some of it's mechanical when the dollar gets too strong you sell what you can to raise dollars not what you want to that's treasuries um number two some of it is geopolitical treasuries for central banks are no longer risk-free instruments if you do something the United States government doesn't like they will take your treasuries full stop they've done it to Russia they've done it to others and that has opened eyes uh the third point is a little more um subtle but it is in a world where you have Peak cheap oil which is to say we're not running out of oil but we're running out of cheap oil it it costs more and more to find marginal barrels of oil when we're in a peak cheap copper world uh where again we're not running out of copper but the copper we find the prospective supplies are much much higher and everyone wants to Electrify everything um then you can't store the reserves that you're going to need to at some point as a nation deploy possibly into oil into copper into Commodities you can't store that in bonds you need to store that in a reserve asset whose value either stays flat or gains versus oil and copper and gold has a very long history of maintaining or increasing its value in oil copper and other commodity terms for example in the last 15 years oil or gold is up roughly 4X uh about 3x to 4X versus oil and a little over 4X against the Goldman Sachs commodity index and in contrast treasury bonds are certificates of confiscation against Commodities in a uh in a peak cheap Copper Peak cheap oil world now if the US debt load was modest such that the FED could credibly say we will raise rates as high as we need to in order to contain inflation and keep treasury bonds as good as gold for oil and for Commodities then we wouldn't be seeing this switch in my view but the problem is with the debt at 120% to GDP and deficits at 7% with near or full employment the United States cannot credibly say we're going to raise rates as much as we need to to stop inflation they can't United States government can't afford much over five or six% on the 10 year we know that we saw it last fall so if you've got a bond that can only raise rates so much in a world where the geology of copper and the geology of oil and Global growth in the global South suggests that the prices of those things are probably going to go up pretty notably over time then you you better store more of your surpluses more of your Central Bank FX reserves in a reserve asset number one that the Americans can't take which is gold in your Vault not treasuries and number two that preserves your country's purchasing power in oil and copper and and commodity terms which is also gold not treasuries so gold therefore becomes the leading Reserve asset for central banks I mean we have seen uh Central Bank purchases of gold at record levels in the last two years uh according to the world gold Council Central Bank net demand uh totaled 290 tons in the first quarter of this year that's the strongest start to any year on record you're saying that as a reserve asset gold is going to overtake us treasuries is that correct yeah it has for the last 10 years and it's really blown out in the last two since we grabbed Russia since we seized Russia's FX reserves absolutely uh it's it's that's exactly what's happening and I think it's going to continue so of course there are lots of ramifications for that including what it means for the price of golden will get there but I want to go back to how in the scenario though you still see the dollar being the global Reserve currency if treasuries are no longer the primary Global Reserve asset us treasur how does the Dollar then maintain its position as the global Reserve currency I think via its usage right it's it's down the doll the treasury bonds are down to 58% of of global reserves and and falling um certainly when you include gold in those numbers which a lot of times they don't when when you look at the dollar share of reserves they usually leave gold out of that because it doesn't paint a nice picture for the dollar it's not what they're trying to sell uh but when you look at do usage it's still 88 or 90 or 92% of global transactions even though foreign you know reserves the dollar share of FX reserves is way below that and falling so I think people are going to be happy to continue to use the dollar I think they'll continue to be happy uh to recycle them the dollars into assets that preserve their purchasing power into American Capital markets uh that preserve their purchasing power but I don't think they're going to be storing their reserves and treasury bonds uh for any number of reasons that we just discussed and I think that's the difference is we're really 10 years into seeing a separation of church and state between the dollar stay's Global Reserve currency uh but the treasury bond loses its status as primary Global Reserve asset uh and ultimately that's a really good thing for America uh that's hugely bullish for America it's not good for uh the America as we've come to see it over the last 20 years which is Wall Street does great Washington does good and the rest of flyover country sort of muddles along uh the treasury bond losing its primary Reserve asset status is wildly bullish for America for American industrial production for the American working class the American middle class it's not as good for Wall Street on a relative basis it's not as good for Washington on a relative basis and those are the types of things that need to happen uh to be blunt for the political stability of America and for American National Security in terms of reshowing the defense industrial place before we unpack why it's good for America I want to go back to this idea that you say the usage of the dollar will continue and look we have this dollarization trend gaining momentum globally various countries taking significant steps to trade in their own currencies instead of the US dollar uh the brics countries for one um Russia and China they've certainly intensified their efforts to bypass the dollar uh President Putin says that 90% of their trade is now conducted in Yuan and rubles uh Indonesia has established a national task force to promote the use of local currency transactions with its trading partners we know Brazil Argentina India Saudi Arabia they've all publicly said and encouraged to trade in their own currencies they're exploring various strategies to diversify their financial systems and reduce dollar dependence uh China and Brazil the world's most populous and six most populous countries working to trade more in their local currencies and uh last year China Saudi Arabia signed a local currency swap agreement worth around7 billion dollar to shift more of their trade away from the dollar according to JP Morgan Chase when it comes to oil an estimated 20% of global Global oil last year was bought and sold in non US dollar terms you know we've got the bricks wanting to launch their own currencies I'm not even getting into the cryptocurrency side of things but the the usage angle I have to question why would the dollar still be used when you have so much of the world actively saying we don't want to use the dollar well I think there's sort of two things two two tracks within that I think in global commodity markets there's absolutely a trend to move away from from pricing selling in the dollar um and I think that will continue because for those countries it's a matter of National Security the brics currency I don't think there's going to be a bricks currency I think the bricks currency is gold I think the bricks currency deal is we're going to trade in local currencies and we're whoever ends up with a surplus is going to redeploy that Surplus back into their counterparties uh local Goods right so you if if you're trading with China and your Russia uh you're going to end up with some Yuan you're going to buy some uh Chinese Goods uh because China is still the factory of the World by a pretty wide margin and anything left over you're going to redeploy into gold and so to me the bricks currency if you will is really gold um in terms of broader usage around the world the dollar is easy to use uh why not spend it right it's it's there's a there's a Gram's law Dynamic to it right which is is you save the good money and you spend the bad the dollar is the bad money fiat currency is the bad money so I think it's the dollar is the best bad money it's easy to spend uh so you're going to spend in dollars and you're going to save in gold and you're going to save in Bitcoin you're going to save in Commodities and heart assets as opposed to saving in treasury bonds that's really what we're watching here which is just a separation of the spending and saving into a non-currency a neutral settlement asset the savings vehicle is becoming neutral and inflation hedged as opposed to just being a treasury bond which is a derivative of the dollar of course like you know so just to play devil's advocate here Luke if other countries want to spend dollars because it's easy to use and you say the systems are all set up to accept dollars they still need to buy dollars right I mean in order to spend them so what does that mean for for the dollar strength and dollar demand Americans are still emitting what uh trillion dollars a year in trade deficits and $2 trillion a year in in fiscal deficits and you know as much as the US government wants to crack down on China with its you know trade policies and and separate from China us has running a$3 trillion combined fiscal and trade deficit and a whole bunch of that's going to China so you know every you know last year we sent I believe it was $280 billion in dollar terms to China so uh that's why I think when you've got these the these the you're going to continue to see those those dollar emissions from the United States um and this is also driving kind of this change because we're seeing what China's been doing with these dollars in the in the old days they bought treasury bonds and they bought stocks and and they bought and they still do buy some stocks but now what they've been buying for the last 105 years are copper mines and oil fields and ports and financing their own military so the dollars are still getting emitted uh but then they're basically getting marked Return to sender and they end up back in the US which over time secularly adds to US inflation so what you have is the world basically saying this is the bad money here America you have it back we'll take the copper mines we'll take the PTO perus in Greece we'll take all these Cobalt mines in Africa we'll take uh a military so that we can guard our own Supply chains in case the Americans want try to cut off the straights of Mala with their carriers we'll take all this hard hard assets Americans you can have your dollars back and as that plays out you're going to see secularly Rising inflation in the US which is I think partly contributing to the secularly rising inflation the sticky inflation we've seen I think it's still early days but we'll see I get that what I'm still not fully understanding Luke is how the dollar then does not get dethroned as the global Reserve currency if everybody's like here take your dollars back and give us these hot assets how does the Dollar by your thesis maintain its status as the global Reserve currency I guess it's a question of how fast it happens I mean ultimately if this happens in the next month um look we go to war with China open War the Dollar's status as structured will have ended in terms of reserved currency what I'm really describing is a version of the dollar having been the reserve currency from 1946 to 1971 right the dollar was a reserve currency from 46 to 71 that's what we called it but the reserve asset was gold pegged to the dollar uh this is where the reserve asset's going to be gold at least for the time being but it's not Peg to any currency it's going to float in all currencies it's really going to be um steady against Commodities steady to Rising slightly against Commodities especially once it gets to a higher level a gold that is so that's it's really a Back to the Future in terms of the structure of the global Reserve currency status dollar was a reserve currency from 46 to 71 it's just a treasury bond wasn't the primary Reserve asset it was gold but what was supporting the American economy then to make that status for the dollar whole lot of manufacturing we were the world's biggest oil producer we had the only standing army um we we were in we were the factory of the world um none of those things are true largely anymore the oil is but sort of well well that's just it and although I know you've mentioned that both Democrats and Republicans both the Trump Administration and the Biden Administration do have one major economic policy in common and that is returning the US to that industrial base restoring us manufacturing but you know that takes a while right you said that the dollar had its strength back then because the US was the dominant Factor of the world we actually made stuff we're not really making stuff anymore other than financial products I mean to a degree so how how does it maintain its status and on what timeline does the US need to resore production for that to happen well the that's a it's a complicated question and and some of it depends on how much inflation you think the electorate is willing to take some of it is dependent on the polic itics of this country we're going to have regardless of who wins we're going to have sort of a lame duck who can't get reelected and so if they're going to do some extreme things relative to the Orthodoxy of the last 40 50 years economically the time to do it is in the next four years uh so look if if we could resore immediately and have the FED yield curve control the whole thing the fed's balance sheet goes to I don't know pick an extreme number $30 trillion they finance5 trillion you know7 trillion deficits for the next four years you know the dollar will probably reprice I don't know dxy 40 you know down from 104 inflation will go nuts Bond holders will lose every you know lose everything in terms on a real basis they'll lose their purchasing power they'll get paid every dime they owe uh in terms of Treasury holders uh but if you did it really fast like that that gives you if if you assume extremes and form the means that gives you some sense I'm still to using the dollar most of the world's still going to be using the dollar just you're not going to be holding treasury bonds you're going to be holding gold and you'll be selling your gold for dollars you'll be selling your stocks for dollars Etc the dollar is not going anywhere um ultimately we would in theory still have an open Capital account that's open for debate but that's why I say it'll still be the reserve currency it's still going to be the most used currency in my view just given as we reshore we're going to have more stuff to buy in dollars so assuming the whole reshoring plan works out now you you mentioned uh the the dollar at 40 referring to the Dixie which is a bosket of other currencies that the dollar is measured against currently it's at around 104 and and in that basket we've got the Euro the pound the Yen the Canadian dollar the Swedish ker and the Swiss frank right no Emerging Market currencies in there so when we measure dollar strength and weakness is the Dixie really the best way to be doing that especially as we're having the Spy forcation of the global monetary system and the bricks positioning differently uh you make a strong case that no it's not the right one that a better one would be some sort of trade weighted basis and you know that's that's certainly a discussion that you can have all right let Let's uh okay we agree we agree on many points I'm just pushing back to play Devil's Advocate and didn't help our viewers understand your theories here Luke by the way let's go back to this idea of of the dollar being repriced and not replaced so repriced according to what repriced based on on the trading partners currency the dollar is wildly overvalued if you want to reshore us industrial production um if if that and and the mechanics of that really right is is we consider what would happen if we aggressively rebuilt out our defense industrial base we would need to run bigger deficits we're already seeing little symptoms of that with what Biden's doing with with with what Trump did uh you run much bigger deficits but again the bond market the US Treasury Market is 120% debt to GDP the United States government cannot abide sustained positive real interest rates without creating this debt spiral we discussed earlier and so if you want to resure you're going to need to have the FED involved basically capping interest rates one way or another or treasury one way or another capping interest rates um and doing that will be negative for the dollar in my view uh and so mechanically how it would work out one way or another in my view so what is the timeline for this that you see happening and why do you think that ultimately this is good for America and you said the America as opposed to uh you know Wall Street and Washington real America why is this a positive and in what timeline do you expect this playing out well we can just take a look at the last 25 years um they've not been good for Washington or for for for real America for the for the bottom 90% most of the gains of the last 35 years have accured to the American 1% not to the not to the middle and working classes the the policy of America really since the mid 80s has been to subjugate the middle and working classes in order to support the real value of the bond market send the jobs to Mexico send the factories to Mexico to keep wage inflation down to lower um to to lower uh wage inflation lower uh rates and make it cheaper for the government to borrow good for the bond market send the jobs and factories to China same reasoning this runs everything in Reverse uh if we're going to reshore and sending all this stuff to China was disinflationary it's going to be inflationary in the other direction uh it stands to reason uh but the differ is it will be American wages will rise so if you are the average American homeowner and you've got a 30-year fixed rate mortgage and it's fixed at three and a half 4% and your wages start growing 6% 7% 8% 10% uh you're getting a uh you're getting a debt Jubilee your house is getting five to six% cheaper every year in real basis relative to your salary your mortgages uh you're basically a debt Jubilee on your mortgage uh yes your costs of living will be higher your your uh food bill and what have you but relative to the the break you're getting relative the gains you'd be getting in your wages um you're going to end up ahead and the flip side of it is is for the holders of those Bonds on a real basis it's terrible it's great for a nominal you're going to get paid homeowners credit risk of mortgages will you know and the duration of mortgages will extend out the credit risks of mortgages and what have you they'll plummet because the inflation will make sure if if a homeowner is getting a 6% wage increase he has a 4% mortgage his credit risk is phenomenal he's going to make that payment no problem downside is is you're going to get done with that mortgage and and it's going to you know that node is going to buy you a lot less real stuff Commodities Etc than it did when you took it on so it's just a reversal of the trend of the last 30 to 40 years that needs to happen because it's simply gone too far it's hollowed out the defense industrial base we're reliant on China to build weapons to face down China using borrowed money from China and components from China and we can see that the middle and working class of any country in the world is its political stability when you Hollow it out you begin to get political extremism political instability and we're seeing that and it's understood at some level in Washington that hey this has gone too far you know there's a there's a Sir James Goldsmith highlighted everything that's happened around this over the last 30 years Sir James Goldsmith highlighted on 60 Minutes with Charlie Rose in 1994 he laid it out exactly and so that's what that's why it's really good for America uh in terms of of reshoring and you've uh recently said that you believe that Yellen US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen wants to effectively undo the economic policy of the last 40 years the on that has benefited Wall Street and Washington it's exactly what she said in the Wall Street Journal she said for 40 years I thought that if someone wanted to send you cheap Goods you should send them a thank you note I would never ever again send China a thank you note um she basically announced the end of 40 Years of US economic Orthodoxy a month ago um and I think it's a really big deal National Security adviser Jake Sullivan announced it to the Brookings Institute about a year ago and and his speech uh was detailed back in February in Politico magazine same thing he said the last 40 Years of US economic policy have been wrong um that's where we are and this is you know critically this is not the Republican Party these are the Democrats so it's fascinating to me to see uh someone sitting in Yellen seat whose perview is the dollar as treasury secretary who has served as fed Governor or excuse me fed president um chairman of the FED obviously uh saying these things these are this this is I mean this is about as big as when Nixon closed the gold window I mean it was a she announc a change to the system she just threw the last 40 Years of economic Orthodoxy in this country in the trash and I think it's super important and how would you encapsulate that change a weaker dollar and a more manufacturing based economy how would you encapsulate that that change that she's now shifting to I think you're going to start to hear it from Washington spun as preparing the American economy for growth and it will be not Nal GDP growth the dollar will be weaker wages will be higher inflation will be higher the bond market will be managed uh the banking system will be turned into a monetary utility to finance the government which is already started but there'll be some sweeteners in there for the banks uh in terms of capital uh roll backs so that they can make uh a nice margin buying negative real yielding treasury Bonds in whatever sizes are required but but I think that's how you're going to hear it is it'll be preparing the US economy for growth um the debt and deficit are not a the debt and deficit are only a problem when the dollar is too strong if you weaken the dollar enough there won't be a deficit there won't be a debt problem uh the issue is really that dollar is too strong for purpose of of growth in this country so intentionally weakening the Dollar by Design is is the new policy how does this tie into this new ex cutive order that President Biden issued in December that vested the treasury secretary with the authority to sanction financial institutions uh particularly those aiding Russia's military industrial complex Yellen said that the treasury Department hasn't use this tool yet how do you see this tool being used in this picture now it's it's kind of a double-edged sword one edge of it is in the very short term and one edge of it is in the longer term right so in the very short term when you do these types of sanctions you're going to create if if they're used you're going to create a shortterm Scramble for dollar liquidity which will create upside to the dollar not downside in the long run what you're going to do is further discredit the US Treasury Bond as a safe store of value at the central bank and foreign official level they will simply stop buying treasuries and as they do that ultimately that will force the US policy makers whether they be fed treasury eventually Congress to create regulations uh take steps whatever to basically create new dollar liquidity to buy these bonds and you basically under they'll be printing money to buy the bonds and they'll call it other things and and it'll be the goal will be not making it look like they're printing money to buy bonds but that's what they're doing and the dollar will follow over time and so that's why I say it's a double-edged sword in the short run you'll create some dollar upside but in the long run you will be dis further discrediting because they've already discredited it by what they did with Russia discrediting the US treasury bond is primary Reserve asset at the Central Bank level further boosting the case for gold becoming that primary Reserve asset for central banks which brings us to the question then Luke what is your outlook for gold then and I believe you said that well the timeline for this playing out I know when we chatted previously you said by around 2030 is that correct I think that's fair I think the next four years are going to be really something because again we've got two presidents no matter who wins they're both going to run industrial policy and they both can't run again so like the time to do this is now and when you look at what is happening with the rate at which US debt and deficits are compounding with the dollar where it is the fiscal situation is acute in America um and so it that all also suggests you know over the next four years we're going to see a lot of progress on this front so I do think it's going to be um I think the world's going to look very different when the next president comes into office in 2028 so let's go 2030 right let's have that as our timeline here what does that mean for gold prices by then I think gold is has barely with even with its 30% move higher since November call it uh has barely begun to reflect a reversion to the mean that if I'm right about it returning to being the primary Reserve asset uh for much for for at the global Central Bank level it needs to be made orders of magnitude bigger in price and and something I've highlighted before for clients has been the uh market value of Us official gold relative to the foreign treasuries foreign heeld treasuries out outstanding that's simply market price of gold times 261 million ounces that the US owns as a percentage of foreign heal treasury outstanding and so when we go back through history what we find is the long-term average of that ratio is 40% roughly 40 per. uh in 1989 when the USSR fell the last time we were in a great power competition or cold war whatever you want to call it that percentage was 20% uh and when we had an honest to goodness dollar crisis like 1979 and 1980 the percentage was 134% now that is a gold bubble that meant that foreign holders of treasuries could have showed up at treasury or fed and said give us our gold and exchanged all of their treasury bonds for gold and the US still would have had a third of its gold left over that's a bubble in in gold fast forward to today this ratio is at 7% seven so gold would need to Triple just to get back to the very bottom of the long of this of this range where we were in 1989 the last time we had a great power competition gold have to rise roughly 6X just to get back to the long-term 50 60y year average of where it traded um in that ratio and and if we like I said if we had an honest to goodness dollar crisis uh gold would have to go up 19x to match the price level it was at in 1980 relative to foreign held treasuries outstanding which just gives you a sense of exactly how exaggerated the growth in US debt has been and how subdued the price of gold has been uh since those periods of time 19x gold at its current price now only if that's where it was in 1980 do the math for me Luke uh 42,000 44,000 now I don't think that's going to happen unless there's an honest to goodness dollar CR which I'm not foreseeing but I think the 20 to 40% ratio right which is 3x to 6X like to me that's just getting back to the long-term average that's like that shows you exactly how much debt we have thrown off over the last 40 years we got very good at exporting treasury bonds and very bad at exporting everything else that's what that tells you and what I'm telling you is and what who cares what I'm telling you what Janet yellen's telling you what Jake Sullivan's telling you with the Department of Defense is telling you is that it's a national security interest of the US to get out of the treasury export business and to get into the stuff export business again but we can't do that without a much weaker dollar and the Arbiter of that's going to be the price of gold mik which brings me to an interesting point regarding the gold oil ratio because that's something that you've recently posted about saying that um we should think of gold oil ratio as a pressure gauge on US Treasury as the primary Global Reserve asset explain that for us yeah so historically gold oil ratio uh a low gold oil ratio is a healthy you know that that's a dominant treasury market as primary Global Reserve asset because you've got a low price of gold which means gold is not competing with treasuries as a reserve asset and you've got a high relatively high price of oil which means there's a lot of uh Petro dollar surpluses being thrown off uh flowing into US dollar denominated assets treasury bonds so low gold to oil ratios that's that's a that's a dominant treasury dominant treasury is primary Global Reserve asset flip it over High gold the oil ratio means Rising High gold high gold price lot more competition for treasury bonds as a reserve asset uh and or relatively low oil price and in a relatively low oil price there's either not a lot of Petro dollar surpluses being thrown off to be recycled into uh treasuries or worse yet it's too low and the price of oil is too low and OPEC plus Etc have to be redeploying their treasuries selling treasuries to smooth over current account deficits to you know fund social programs over there to prevent political instability so uh that's why the gold oil ratio I think think Rising is conveying a really important message which is you know it's at a key level here it's at 30 or 31 and and like almost everybody thinks okay well it's been at 31 before and it rolls over except basically every single thing in macro is telling you it's going to keep going higher you're seeing the bricks recycle into gold you're seeing Yellen throw 40 Years of economic Orthodoxy in the trash you're seeing the FED say we're not going to let Treasury auctions treasury market dysfunction we will add liquidity when that's it's needed so I think ultimately again nobody trusts a Chinese and even if they did China doesn't want to open their capital account and issue debt they don't want the system the Americans had from 1971 to to present they want to use gold no one trusts the Russians they will want gold the Japanese don't want it even if they could they're not big enough gold Europeans don't want it even if they could gold so gold is is is doing what it's doing because gold is taking the place of Treasury bonds as a primary Reserve asset globally at the Central Bank level and as that happens that's a whole lot of buying against a gold market whose annual production is 240 billion look the oil Market globally is like 13 times that annually in physical production terms that's just the oil market so the if you want to start fitting commodity surpluses into gold price pricec is going to have to get a lot higher and so I think the gold to oil ratio is going to go a lot higher over time so Luke where does digital gold fit into this picture how does Bitcoin play into this scenario where gold takes over the US Treasury as the primary Global Reserve asset but the dollar maintains its status as the global Reserve currency how does Bitcoin fit into this I think it's really good for Bitcoin I look at Bitcoin as a as an energylink new mutal Reserve asset for the people uh the energy link is the proof of work algorithm where you have to spend uh a lot of electricity to to create a Bitcoin and then to continue to spend electricity to maintain the network uh and so it is it is a digital gold like instrument in that way uh when you then layer over what we're really talking about here which is increasing periods or more frequent periods of increasing dollar liquidity injected in order to us deficits because Global central banks aren't anymore they're buying gold uh ultimately that means you know more dollar liquidity weaker dollar that's good for Bitcoin so I I really like Bitcoin as well it does a lot of things that gold does arguably better than gold um but again it's got a lot more volatility it's a much smaller market so I'm I I think it's everything we've discussed here is very good for Bitcoin do you see central banks buying Bitcoin as a reserve asset maybe someday when it gets a lot bigger uh it's just too small right now but conceivably there's no reason they couldn't and if the Dollar's usage continues right and the central banks are buying gold what role do you see Bitcoin playing as a currency as um a medium of storing value what is the primary function of Bitcoin in this scenario I think it's primarily a store of value a pristine store of value a very hard and increasingly hard store of value uh over time um you that can then get into discussions of of uh usage as as collateral uh for other markets Reserve asset usage at some point uh conceivably you could see it move so to speak right to be used it as a medium exchange but I don't think it makes any sense it doesn't make as much sense to use as a medium exchange until way down the road when the price is much higher and the volatility is much lower so uh for the moment for the foreseeable future I just see it as a a very hard asset store of value with an energy link uh for the people and what about for the still foreseeable future that uh what four and a half year outlook that you have for 2030 where you have your potential anywhere from 3x to 6X to 19x Gold what does that mean for Bitcoin in that time frame Bitcoin I think probably would go up more than gold would uh in that scenario um on higher volatility so if gold goes up 3x I wouldn't be surprised if if Bitcoin goes up I don't know four five Sixx in that world so uh I think I think they can both win but why why would gold but Bitcoin be going up we we've you've made the case for gold with central banks but why do you see Bitcoin even potentially outperforming gold in the scenario of laid out oh that's that's simple the $130 trillion bond market is the sucker at the card table and it's going to figure that out and as it figures that that out it's going to sell bonds buy me something that holds value and then that something that holds value will be 65 trillion of US stocks right now 14 trillion of gold right now 1.4 trillion of Bitcoin right now and that process will continue until the bond selling gets so high that it forces treasury dis dysfunction or it forces rates to a point where the US government cannot afford its debt load and then the fed and treasury will come in and print more money to constrain that which will only back feedback into gold Bitcoin stocks the incentive of whatever is left in the $130 trillion bond market to get out into those other assets faster wash Rin repeats so there's a way in which this goes without a massive productivity Miracle uh that things could really feed themselves very quickly so you mentioned that this is also beneficial for equities which will function as an inflation hedge as well in in this kind of scenario what particular sectors do you think would do well I prefer Industrials uh in the US but really globally I think Japanese equities would do well I I personally really like electrical infrastructure equities so uh us uh Industrials that have huge uh or that have big exposure to uh expanding and maintaining the grid um those types of things uh those are the those are some of the things we have talked about that I think will do well but ultimately uh you know it's a$1 130 trillion doll bag trying to fit into a $65 trillion bag so I think uh in terms of the bond market scrambling into to stock market and then getting backfilled by us authorities printing more money to make sure yields don't go too high that they can't afford them wash Rance repeat so I think it's you know we we're watching stocks rate against bonds we're watching gold rate against bonds we're watching Bitcoin and and and the NASDAQ rate against bonds and we're like 12 to 18 months into it and most Market participants as far as I can see don't even understand what they're watching yet so I think we're still very early days okay so you think Bitcoin will do three times what gold does in the scenario if if I can just circle back to that to get clarity on there con con conceivably yeah I mean that's now why three times three times is a big enough number that expresses The View that I think it will do a lot more than gold without being crazy like there's no science to that in terms of it uh some of that will depend on uh acceptance rates some of that will depend on volatility Etc but I think go Bitcoin would outperform gold in that scenario just by of look you have a $130 trillion bond market it's going to have more of an impact on a $1.4 trillion Bitcoin Market than it does on a $14 trillion gold market all El equal as an individual investor a lot of people have money parked in the treasury market because you're getting a risk-free you know 5% more or less right are you saying that it's time to start moving away from that play or still a good place to park money in in the short term I think it depends on on what your individual investment needs are uh for me personally and and I think for a lot of individuals I still own a lot of t- bills uh five and a quarter I have a portion of my portfolio and five and a quarter t- BS I have no allocation to tenure treasuries at 4.4% I don't know why I would own long-term treasuries at 4.4% when the short term is at 5 and a qu quarter when I know I've done the math that a US recession will increase net treasury supplies so much that the 10-year treasury yield will probably go up not down in a recession and as such a US recession is really number one it's not going to be a palatable policy option so they're going to react very quickly because deficits will absolutely explode but number two in light of everything we've discussed you really it it's when you're run into 2 trillion deficits it's really impossible to have a nominal recession unless you want to stand aside and either slash entitlement slash defense to make room for interest or the fed and treasur are willing to stand aside and let the treasury market dysfunction up to an including failed treasury auction and failed banking system and they're not going to do that so if they're not going to do that then failing a productivity Miracle uh which is a big caveat like there's there's there's almost no way to have a nominal recession real Rec sure but nominal recession I don't want to buy long-term bonds if there's not if there really can't be a nominal recession you're not going to get you know there's a lot of people own long-term treasuries on this view that you know growth's about to collapse or if there's a recession that you know the yields going to go from 44 back to one and I'm G to make a lot of money like if we if if if growth collapses the US deficits going to go from 7% to nearly 15 or 20% and foreigners are going to be add add on top of that you're going to need to finance like 20 to 25% of GDP in treasuries on a net effective basis and I think yields go up in that world in a recession so I just for me I think T bills fine I I I think that makes perfect sense like I said I own I own a slug of them myself for the average individual investor four 4.4% 10e treasuries and they don't make any sense to me the long end to me is is the bubble right so you mentioned a caveat uh of productivity what could happen to derail this entire thesis of yours um if you have ai or some sort of automation show up basically on the exact perfect time scale so not too fast not too slow it's got to be like Goldilocks arrival because if it arrives too slow then it doesn't change anything that we just discussed and if it arrives too fast you're going to be talking about unemployment rates shooting F higher much higher much faster which is going to send tax receipts through the floor it's going to send counter cyclical payments for unemployment what's what what have you up nonlinearly and so your deficits are going to blow out and you're right back to the scenario I just highlighted you're going to have a recession you're going to have consumers unable to pay their Consumer loans Etc you basically get into a sort of a great financial crisis scenario if automation AI productivity gains arrive too fast so it has to arrive at sort of Just Right which I think is a small and and shrinking possibility uh there's geopolitical sides I mean look if if there's some sort of political turnover in China and Russia such that either or both leaders are replaced by us friendly that you know the Chinese begin stocking up on Treasury bonds that lose 2 to 4% a year in against inflation so they can Finance our deficits and finance their own military encirclement and you know Putin gets turned over and they replace them with some puppet that sells us Commodities at a really nice price and only in dollars to everybody then that would work too again I don't think either one of those are very likely to happen but those are the types of things that could completely change that um you know so we'll see uh there are productivity things they could do in terms of healthcare and such like if we you know if if in theory if if you replace you know you put up an app that allows everybody to to to be able to see a doctor very efficiently and get rid of a lot of Administrators and paperwork Etc you could do that but again if it happens too fast Healthcare last I checked was like 16 177% of GDP you start firing a whole bunch of people you're going to create unemployment you're going to create deficits on top of the deficit that's too big already and top of the debt that's too big already and it creates a fiscal a fiscal crisis and a debt crisis so uh the debt debt kills debt kills and leverage Cuts right so the problem is we're so highly levered our wiggle room is very very small in terms of these types of productivity Miracles that could arrive in time not just in time but at a pace that doesn't create a bigger problem than it solves all right Luke thank you for helping us see uh the forest for the trees here final thoughts as we wrap up I think it's you know the final thoughts I would have is is understanding that position sizing is really key is this is I would not be all in Gold I'd not be all in Bitcoin it's going to be very important to be uh Diversified and to be unlevered uh because I think everything we've just described here given the political nature of it uh and seemingly increasing political nature of it is is likely to be an environment of increased Financial Market and possibly geopolitical volatility so it's something to be aware of all right stay Diversified and of course make sure to uh read your newsletters uh Luke thank you so much really really appreciate your time and your Insight and

digital currencies the global bank messaging Network Swift is planning a new platform to connect all the Central Bank digital currencies now in development to the existing Financial system this platform is expected to launch within the next 2 years and would be one of the most significant developments for the N cbdc ecosystem given Swift key role in global banking currently around a 90% of the world's central banks are exploring cbdcs which are programmable digital currencies that operate a sphar currency and are controlled and issued by central banks they can be used to monitor every single transaction obliterating privacy and anonymity and can be programmed to work or not work depending on the nature of that transaction and cbdcs according to my next guest are a critical part of the agenda for a new Financial World Order she warns that there is a great reset ahead that we are on the precipice of a financial World War where fortunes will change and financial Stakes will shift she cautions that the global Elite are jocking to come out on top in this new order and that in the process will leave us owning nothing and having less freedom and control over our lives Carol Roth is a New York Times best-selling author her most recent book is you will owe nothing her other best sellers include the entrepreneur equation and the war on small business she's also a self-proclaimed recovering investment banker and an advocate for economic freedom and wealth creation Carol thank you for joining us great to have you here on Kitco so nice to be with you Michelle so Carol I really really really enjoyed the book as I mentioned I I love the way that it it brings together various phenomenon explains the links connect the dots if you will and I'll get into cbdcs which I mentioned at the top and digital IDs and social credit scores and how this all ties in together and the role of big Tech and the world economic Forum so we we have a lot to unpack here but let's start off with an overview of the coming World War f as you call it that you're saying is imminent so this all sounds very conspiratorial doesn't it that there's going to be a new world order and oh that sounds very scary and only the people who are crazy would say that but if you go to the White House's website and you look at remarks that President Biden gave to the Business Roundtable which is a group of the major Business Leaders here in the United States um many publicly traded companies in the like if you go back to I think it was March of 21 he talks about the fact that on a regular basis things change in the financial order and says there is going to be a new world order out there and we have got to lead that and I'm sure the way he was talking about was the people in the room and him and not necessarily me or anybody who's listening here but this is the reality that we're in you know we in particularly in the United States have been very very blessed to live through this incredible period in history where the US has been at the center of the Global Financial system we the holder of the world Reserve currency and we're about 80 years into that cycle but before us it was the British and before the British it was the Dutch and so I would imagine at those point in times when you're in that pull position you feel very Invincible about it and you can't imagine that there might be another time when things are are changing but if we look at the reality of debt loads in the United States and The Debt Service and all of the printing that's gone around on around the world and the fact that the FED has not done a good job of holding the reserve currency stable uh not only you know internationally but also in the US you're seeing some of these shifts happen you're seeing the brics countries looking at other Alternatives you're seeing central banks get rid of treasuries and stock up on gold and so you're starting to see these shifts and changes happen so if you're somebody who is smart and successful and powerful and connected and you see that Stakes are changing in the world as President Biden did as the people from The Business Roundtable do you know something is going to shift you don't know exactly when but you want to make sure sure when it does that you come out on top and so that really sets the stage for all of the things that were T going to be talking about today and what I've been talking about in the book is that there is this change coming and with the elite wanting to come out on top in many ways it's not so much that they're trying to intentionally keep you down it's not that we have these people sitting around the table like Dr Evil going oh you know how do we you know Corner the markets but they are trying to preserve their power and their wealth and if yours has to go away in order for that to happen then that's just okay by them and so we'll see that over and over again as we talk about the themes as we talk about cbdc as we talk about social credit as we talk about Wall Street coming in and competing with individuals to buy housing all these kinds of things that we talk about that it's making harder to seize on that wealth creation opportunity and in America the American dream you know those are the kinds of things that I'm trying to get at in a very non-conspicuous having a a very realistic conversation about what it is that we're living through and Carol the idea of ownership is very critical here and it's an issue you highlight in the book and you point out the efforts to erode the individual's ownership of real assets by governments by big Tech and by the elite power Grabbers as you call them ownership a central theme in the book and you write quitting UT you private property is the guardian of every other right property rights are fundamental to wealth creation studying economics and history you can see that the Advent of individual property rights brought prosperity and abundance to the world studying wealth creation at the individual level you can see that the way that individuals create wealth is through ownership ownership is enhanced with a commitment to property rights and is threatened without such commitment it is not a coincidence that Marxist communist and other derivative regimes of control don't have property rights and ownership as tenants other than for those in the Inner Circle or Elite ranks once you as an individual own nothing it is easy for the government or similar Center of power to gain figurative ownership and control over you I will say this many times to hit at home if you own nothing they own you so explain that to Carol why is ownership so important to Liberty and freedom I mean it really is the Cornerstone of what I've learned you know 30 years in the financial markets you know as I said recovering investment banker it is the one truth that that the people who are wealthy became wealthy because they owned assets and they owned assets that not only retain their value but also had the opportunity to appreciate and value so those two concepts are just absolutely intertwined but as you said it kind of extends past that it goes to freedom and let me use the the idea of a house for example to explain both of those in the United States and and I talk about this in the book and and have all the charts and graphs that back it up but the the number one asset on household balance sheets across the United States is a house lots of reasons for that but probably because you know unlike a stock where you get you panic and you trade in and out of it you know if you have kids in school and a job you're not all of a sudden trading your house because you know Zillow says one day that it's worth less so you really have that duration duration is helpful in terms of creating um you the capital appreciation opportunities and being able to to cash in on that so people have homes and when you have this sort of movement whether it's intentional or not but Wall Street coming in and and competing to buy homes or people not being able to afford homes or just selling this idea that oh come rent this house with all these amenities and it's a much better lifestyle than maybe this smaller house that you could actually purchase yourself well then you're giving up not only that biggest opportunity to create wealth on a an average household balance sheet but you're also giving up your sovereignty so if you are living under somebody else's roof it is much easier for them to tell you what to do if the government wants to get rid of gas stoves or whatever insane idea they have you know for the day it's much easier for them to affect that through a group of corporate landlords that to say to me hey you've got to move that out of your house and so to the extent that you want to control more people or to get them to give up sovereignty U that happens when people don't own homes so it really is this one two punch of wealth creation and freedom that are so much in intertwined and Michelle you know when I when people hear the title of the book that you will own nothing and think that it's just entirely about the the world's economic Forum it really wasn't it was really about the fact that people were having a challenge with creating wealth and I was looking at all of these disperate areas and going what is the through line and this prediction that they had for 2030 you they top number one out of eight predictions was you'll own nothing and you'll be happy which became this crazy meme across social media it really created a perfect through line and if you think about just the phrasing of that first of all it's you'll own nothing not will own nothing like the people who are projecting this and uh and predicting this are not including themselves in that group um unlike the way Biden did with that new world order statement but the other idea is that you'll be happy and as you mentioned the the quote that you said uh that from the book The people throughout history who have not had ownership who have not had property rights who haven't been able to own these assets that are valuable they have not been happy they have not been wealthy and in many cases they have starved to death or you know otherwise lost their lives so this notion to get people to buy into this ease if you don't own things you can have this Carefree lifestyle but you're you know you give up the wealth you give up the freedom don't worry about that you'll be happy if you get someone to buy into that psychologically it's much easier to affect this change than it is if people say no my happiness comes from my ownership my ability to create wealth my sovereignty and my be my being able to chart my own path and not having somebody else with that quote unquote ownership over me but let's expand on that uh because it's not just about home ownership as you point out in in the book we don't really you know you take a step back and all of a sudden you realize what do you own people don't own cars everybody's used well the majority of people depending in in in big cities are using Ubers and even people that do own cars as you point out you know you in in some places you're you're leasing an operating system right like there subscription services for added revenue streams like paying to teach your car seats in some cars as as as they're sold in parts of the world you point out that sure I may own the phone the hardware but do I really have control over being able to use it or not if the operating system is owned by you know Apple for example and they can decide to just cut me off there so it extends well beyond just home ownership and so I want you to expand on the idea of property private property and I take that again not just as homes is the guardian of every other right it sure is so you know you can think about all the things that you own that are assets that have a significant amount of value the homes as we talked about um you know owning stocks or owning bonds or even owning alternative assets you know those are kind of the things that you think about and there are other things that you use where it may be more convenient and it's not really an appreciable asset where you don't have the ownership we know cars are depreciating assets but at the same time it is a trade-off from freedom because you know if you have to depend on public transportation or Uber or whatnot again you are at the mercy of all of those um you know different entities so you have to really think about that so I think that's really the balance that uh I need we need people to think about in the digital realm when we get to technology you know they really want to rent your entire life back to you as a subscription or a service they want you to own nothing but our digital rights really do hang in the balance and I think that with AI coming out as a major eruptive force and coming fast and furiously people are starting to think more about that and in a way you know we have these you know so-called protections at least here in the United States with the Constitution around what it is that our rights are but we don't have that in when we operate in the digital sphere and you have these massive tech companies who you know have market caps that are are bigger in some cases than the gdps of certain countries mostes of the countries in the world that have more users than some of the biggest countries in the world and have this crazy amount of power and we just really take it for granted that we can have access to all of the things that they're providing but at the end of the day as you said you know we've got these these wonderful phones but I I don't own anything other than you know glass and microchips and some plastic that if the I'm cut off from the operating system and I'm cut off from my email and all the things things that are important to my workflow and to connecting with other people and being able to use my voice on EX formerly known as Twitter or whatnot I really don't own own anything and I think that's where you can start to see U both the wealth creation peace and the freedom peace kind of come together and see how they're so intertwined in this message about ownership and really why it's important for us um at this nent time you know in living in this these sort of digital worlds that we spend more time talking about digital rights and making sure that our rights are secured right and you point out how you know we don't really have much Choice when it comes to these digital rights you get a user agreement and you can either accept or not accept and if you don't accept well too bad it's not like you can come back and say well Clause 17b I'm not that comfortable with right and if you don't accept you're effectively cut out of a system which is integral to the functioning of society I will definitely get back to the tech Titans and their role but I want to focus on what you said about the world economic forum and the title of the book because as you mentioned the title comes from the eight predictions for the world in 2013 posted by the world economic Forum on Twitter now X back in 2018 created from an article that they published in 2016 this isn't some conspiracy theory Claus Schwab says this all the time you talk about um Dr Evil I mean some could say he looks like a Central casting for a bond villain but but nonetheless you've got clus Schwab uh saying as it is said in that list you will owe nothing and you will be happy whatever you want you will rent so why don't you give us some background here on CLA Schwab we know he formed the world economic Forum in 1971 but for those that aren't familiar with it or just know it as the organization that puts together Davos where the rich and Powerful gather um in the winter of every year give us the background that we need to understand here and why we need to be concerned by their agenda yes so with class Schwab the one piece of credit I'll give him is he's one of the most persistent individuals I've ever seen he's had these messed up messages and he has been trying to push them repackage them repurpose them entrench them like you said since 1971 when it was originally called the European management Forum I believe and uh you know as things shifted in sort of the geopolitical landscape what was sort of these these business ideas started to attract people from the political Arena and the like and uh somehow he just managed to to sort of put himself in the middle of a lot of uh very powerful people and so he was able to kind of keep putting out his message one of the most interesting takeaways is that since that time in 1971 where when he founded the European management Forum the wef predecessor he also put out a book and this concept of the stakeholder kind of popped up at that point in time and it really ties into everything that we're talking about here he very clearly is trying to con con basically conflate uh the concept of a stakeholder with a shareholder if you are a shareholder in something and a in a company for example you've gotten that way because you've either put something at risk or you well because you put something at risk it could be your capital or it could be your time and your Blood Sweat and Tears but you have taken that risk and you are getting compensation for the risk and that is why you are deriving benefit his idea of a stakeholder is incredibly vague it's anybody who wants to come along and basically free ride off of what uh a company or some other entity is doing and say oh well I have an important stake in this well you have taken no risk you have done nothing and he's been trying to conflate these issues and we see them popping up over and over again as the WF has EF has unfolded and certain ideas which have been entrenched and populated by them something like ESG which we know has infected you know all of corporate America and we're just starting to get some push back on um that goes back to this this concept of you know what is this quote unquote stakeholder that really doesn't have a stake in the asset in the game and the in the creation of something valuable in taking that risk and so I think that's probably the most important take way is that you have these people who want to free ride on what other people are doing and you know benefit off of their work and risk and that has been inherent but when you hear stakeholder it sounds like they have a stake but they really do not give us a clearer picture of who these people are as you say because the world economic forum's tentacles reach far and wide to give us a sense of who are the members of the world economic Forum why they're powerful why we really should pay attention when Claus Schwab says he has an agenda so the interesting thing is if you look at like their world their yearly event that they produce called Davos or you go to their website and you look at some of the quote unquote thought leadership or articles they are incredibly well connected with the who's who of world political leaders and companies they have a list of Partnerships and you'll go through some of the biggest companies in the world world and you'll notice that they are named Partners you'll notice that there are lots of political leaders who have attended and it's challenging to sort out who is just there because everybody else is there and this is a way where I can make deals and get an ego boost and whatnot and who's really carrying uh these you know bad ideas back and putting them into practice one thing that um I encourage everybody to look up is the video of clous Schwab at the Harvard Kennedy School of government when he talks about this um program they have the young global leaders and this is where they identify political leaders and sort of bring them into the wef system and you have people like Canada's Justin Trudeau and chrisa Freeland who have been part of these um part of these leaders and he cites them and he's like you know when you when you look around and I go to these things you know you have to penetrate the cabinets and I look around and I know all these people and they've been part of the wef world uh the global leader program and so when you have somebody like CLA Schwab say we penetrate the cabinets I'm not sure what else that might mean other than we penetrate the cabinets so while this is supposed to be a non-governmental organization and NGO it seems like they're very very entrenched in government and when you see their ideas like the esgs popping up with all of the publicly traded companies with the most powerful Business Leaders in the world then you start to say well clearly there's some connection here this didn't just happen organically where everybody thought of this at the same time it's coming from somewhere and uh again very persistent he's been in the middle of all of this and if you look at the different entities that are around him some of the some of them are there with the best of intentions I'm sure but a lot of them are taking this nonsense and bringing them back to their countries and trying to quote unquote affect change in a way that is sort of Nono non-governmental Central planning which is as bad as any other type of central planning when you have a handful of people who are trying to make decisions uh for the masses because they think they're better or smarter because they have more power it's done very opaquely and then that gets you know pushed into the system the other thing I will say is that the um wef is very entrenched with the United Nations and one of the things in my book as I was researching all of these different issues that names that keep kept popping up again were wef United Nations and some others and at some point it's like well okay maybe this is a coincidence but when it's over and over and over again I don't believe that that's coincidental any longer right and you have uh these un uh goals which seem to align quite nicely with the world economic Forum goals but before we get more into that how are they exerting power though how are they so they they bring in these leaders and they're just influencing them through thought how is this power actually exerted and manifests itself in intangible ways that Le back to this agenda that's really a good question um I don't think it's as formal as some people might like to think it is I think that you get people in a room and you say this is you know what we're going to push and here's how it's going to benefit us and go back and go to it you know something like ESG which I keep bringing up again because it's just been such a big push you know with such a clear grab for power and wealth and influence that you know I don't know that there was a A playbook that was put out and you have to do this thing but by bringing in all of these key players people who are influencing um the choices of shareholders like you know Black Rock and Larry Frink who was a really big person in terms of bringing it you know from a world economic Forum discussion Point into actually penetrating publicly traded companies now of course he's trying to distance himself from it but you know that is the reality of of how these things came to be um I think it's you know here's how we can benefit here's the the money and the power lines and you know everyone says that sounds great I'm on board this is the new thing and they each go out and and put it out in their own way um but you know it is this this connection between these organizations that Foster these sort of centrally planned bad ideas and lay out the benefits for the people who then bring them back and you know make us subject to all of them right centrally planned bad ideas which work to erode people's freedom under the guise that it is for what they deemed to be the greater good you mentioned ESG and you know that links to the idea of climate change and that agenda and a number four on the list you'll eat much less meat and occasional treat not a staple for the good of the environment and our health so that's uh number four on the list there but let's focus on number two on the list of the world economic Forum agenda for 2030 because that is equally as disturbing as you will own a nothing and part of how the soul fits in and they say that the US will not be the world's leading superpower a handful of countries will dominate and you started to bring that up at the top of this interview it's a topic that you break down in great detail in the book regarding the US losing its status as the superow as other empires have before it like the Romans like the Dutch like the British and you break that down in tremendous detail the the history of those Empires how they fell and how the US has essentially abused the exorbitant privilege of having the global Reserve currency and you're saying that as the dollar life cycle comes to an end as has been the fate of all Reserve currencies uh that the elites are positioning themselves for the great reset so expand further on that idea yeah I I mean I think that um as we talked about at the top of the hour that it is clear that there is some sort of life cycle going on and certainly a lot of people can see it what's been interesting in all of these cases when there has been a major shift is that it always comes internally it's not that there's some other superpower that has challenged the one that was in place and said I'm going to take this Torch from you it's always sort of implosion from the inside and you know we we've seen the movie before I attribute a lot of this to just human nature but you get you know this this um you know basic sort of push and pull between reality and debt loads and countries cannot help themselves the the politicians get power by creating spending opportunities that they can go then and and buy votes with and so there's always sort of this carelessness this moral hazard if you will um related to the fact that they don't bear the the consequences for their financial actions so you get this insane debt you start to get um less investment um in things important things like defense you know we are on a trajectory here in the US where we've got the interest on the debt which is now surpassing to are spending yearly on defense um Neil Ferguson has his own law which says that you you know you can't basically I'm paraphrasing but you can't have a a great country when you're spending more on debt service than you are on on the the defense of your country so you get this you get these sort of class Wars that happen and you know it's just all very much a a historical rhyme as they say so we're seeing that happen and I think some people misinterpret this they misinterpret it that oh the dollar is going to go away and there's going to be no more dollar we're not saying that that's the case but what we're saying is a shift in the amount of trade that's done in dollars or the shift in you know how much treasuries are are being bought and by whom and you know all of these things impact how our government can B borrow our own ability to uh to kind of live in a in a nation that for many years was you know not subject to massive inflation and have a certain standard of living and I think that's the part that people aren't really appreciating as the dollar has been a weaponized right against Russia that basically saying that you know we're going to seize your reserve currencies and you know now they're looking to give those to Ukraine you know who wants to let the US hold the reserve currency if they can just make those kinds of decisions the same thing you know goes when you have Comm ities like food and energy that are priced in dollars and that's not held stable if that becomes you know much more expensive for a country because you know it's more expensive more dollars are required to to purchase those well all of a sudden that becomes a national security and an economic security issue for those countries so you really can't blame them for wanting to look to Alternatives and you know we've seen the shift we've seen there's actually a great chart by Luke groman who I understand may be coming up on the program um you know in in coming interviews and one that he's put on a lot of our Radars that shows that over the last decade the amount of Central Bank debt or excuse me the amount of uh US Government debt that we've incurred has you know more than doubled went from 16 trillion to now we're at you know 35 trillion at the same period of time central banks on the world around the world were actually net sellers of Treasury their treasury holding went down by about a hundred billion dollar so you no longer have these central banks who are loading up on treasuries and the interesting Dynamic is that they're not going into another currency per se but they're going into gold as their supplement so we are starting to see these shifts and changes and as I said I think just the perspective of people thinking that the whole thing needs to collapse versus is you know a meaningful shift will have meaningful changes on our way of life and I think that I want people to be more focused on the latter not to say that the first couldn't happen over time but we still have a massive economy in the US and a lot of really good things going for us but does that mean that the next you know 20 or 50 years is going to look like the last 20 or 50 years probably not right and you know Carol you discussed the weaponization of the dollar which many say is a pivotal moment right by taking Russia off the Swift system and and I started off this uh segment by discussing how the Swift system is adopting cbdcs so there's clearly a connection there but you talk about the weaponization of the dollar and you bring up a very interesting question of how much of this is potentially intentional or by Design because of the mismanagement if you will of the FED which may be intentional or by Design as well and again quoting you to you is it possible that the weaponization of the dollar is intentional perhaps to give support to the notion that the US doesn't want a dollar Reserve currency and is that all a cover because the government knows they have mismanaged the currency or is removing the US's standing in the world financially in and of itself part of setting up this new Financial World Order does it tie into some of the other changes going on in terms of global Finance power and control what we can project is that the US is in the Twilight of its Financial Empire the end of King Dollar and a us-led financial World Order will lead to disorder before any stable new Financial world order this disorder will lead to chaos in all kinds of ways without the US willing or perhaps able to step in and given that its currency no longer holds the same threat it used to further competition for scarce resources will happen with nobody to play referee this will likely lead to Wars famine and a mass massive death toll around the world the world will be turned upside down and new alliances will be formed kind of send shivers down my spine even though I've read this for the fifth time but uh I mean do you think that this you know could be by design that this could be a way to You Know cover up for for much of the mismanagement you do point out with concrete back facts to substantiate it how the FED is to blame for much of the troubles that that we've seen since the formation of the FED yeah I mean it it is all monetary and fiscal policy that has created these ills as I said this is not an outside force looking in that's uh you know weakening us we're doing it from the inside out you know as to the question of whether it's intentional you know I left it as this question and then sort of my projection because in a way it doesn't matter I mean some people might think it's fun to go through the you know the intentional versus the the not intentional who's stupid who's doing this on purpose is this cover is this just you know human nature from my perspective Michelle this it doesn't make a difference you know this is the reality that we're in so whether they're trying to do it somewhat fully intentionally fully intentionally or not intentionally at all I kind of don't care what I care about is what's going to happen on the other side of it and there are a lot of things that are at play you know you mentioned that the chaos and potential for war obviously we're seeing some of that um percolate up you know since the the book has been written one of the things that we know is that not every war brings about a new Financial world order but every new Financial world order has been preceded by War so that too can be a mechanism to try to change and reset things and I read theories all the time about you know what is going to happen and how all of this is going to get sorted out um that you know many of of it is sort of intentional things that governments can do and you know my job is to not to figure out which of those are intentional I don't I don't find that fun what I find important is to prepare people and make sure that they're aware that things are going to shift and you know to be thinking about it and and so that they can take control control over what they can control because we're not going to be able to control you know whether somebody you know over over in the world economic Forum or the fed or the government is pushing a a new world order but we can control what we're doing on a on a micro on a personal basis and so I think that's the most important thing and we will get to that we will get to how you help people prepare for battle or to push against this but I want to focus on and we touched on this a little bit before but the other big Power here which is the tech Titans right because you've said in many ways that they are taking over the role of government uh and you're right well the government may be trying to keep you from ownership in a variety of ways Tech firms and applications are uh ensuring a lack of ownership with subscription models making you a lifetime renter this is what the world economic Forum predictions meant when they talked about products being turned into services and you talk about the digital Gatekeepers and how we've in effect given given so much of our rights and even government rights to these Tech Giants that government has very little control over our Our Lives certainly as compared to how they used to so elaborate on on the force of Technology here in this great reset yeah so we talked about earlier the example of a a smartphone and that you really own you know just this this brick but that you know if you don't have the operating system you don't have the email then you have issues um when you think about the choice you have you have two companies that own 99.9% or something like that of the operating systems in the entire world so you know if you decide to opt out of one you have one other choice and if you're opted out of both of them then you've been opted out of participating basically in you modern society and so that's why the whole concept of thinking about rights and pushing back on some of these things that seem super conven venience um is important you know one of the things as I did the uh the initial tour for my book is I told people that they should go out and they should buy a physical copy of my book because you know these powerhouses have so much power that if you buy a digital version you know how do we know that they're not going to shift and change the language over time I don't know that and you know maybe there's something in a in an agreement that I signed along the way that allows them to do that as a writer I'm very concerned um about AI you know as somebody like yourself who is is a a television personality a media personality presenter you know just our own being able to own our our names our likenesses you know the the uh things that are unique to us as human beings as they tried to use technology to consolidate that so when we think about speech when we think about you know the rights to privacy when we think about the rights to ownership you know all of that is not really being protected well in the digital realm which is becoming bigger and more powerful U frankly than even the government is I mean if you think about you know who has more of an impact on your day-to-day life you I would say for most people it probably is these big tech companies and there are a handful of them and they have just incredible balance sheets that are rock solid um at least for some period of times like like we've never seen you know trillion multi-trillion dollar market caps so it is something that I think is important to pay attention to and for us to spend more time speaking up and trying to get our rights protected in the same way that they've been protected against the government because you know the tech companies love it it really benefits them for everybody to go along with it and they're able to groom people I mean if you think about younger people they are groomed to not have ownership of anything in the way that you know somebody like myself had ownership even of just you things like toys and music and whatnot growing up that they don't know from that so this idea that you don't have to own things really starts to become entrenched and which is why spreading this message I think is so important to get younger people to make sure that they start thinking about physical tangible ownership and what that means for wealth and freedom right and you you point out the gamification that comes through these tech companies as you just said you know it's digital toys it's digital music you're owning less and less and giving away that power by the way for the record I did get the physical book I do like to actually read the hard coffee I find it you know much easier to consume information the oldfashioned way what can I say so no one's going to be changing what you wrote in in in this cop here but you know this all comes into this idea of well tokenization and Central Bank digital currencies um and before we unpack Central Bank digital currencies you mentioned Black Rock a few times in the book you mentioned Larry fink a few times Black Rock the world's largest asset manager and the CEO of Black Rock Larry thinkink he has been very vocal about tokenization lately saying that it's the next step for markets is the tokenization of all Financial assets and that's already on the way so how does tokenization and that is a digital representation of an asset of a black on on a blockchain of sorts further fuel this idea of you not having ownership and therefore less freedom and less control so I'll put the tokenization discussion in the framework of currency because I think that is sort of the best way to understand what it is we're talking about so obviously when you have a government and a Fed that has not been careful that has not um they've been derelict in their Duty right to to to keep our currency stable to not uh you know basically debase the currency um you know you have people who realize that and are looking for different ways around that and I think that's been probably the primary driver and interest in cryptocurrency is let's get this decentralized away from these Central planners away from these people who you know aren't bearing risks who have no accountability and you know let people have more control that's really what that's about it's about preserving wealth it's about having controled Freedom what the governments that are exploring cbdc and as you said you know pretty much every government in some way is exploring this the FED although they claim they're not really doing anything right now they have run pilot programs and they have done research and and whatnot so it it's definitely been on the table but I think what is happening is an intentional conflation between central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency and a central bank currency is the exact opposite in terms of purpose and focus and what it stands for than a cryptocurrency where you have something Bitcoin which is entirely decentralized the whole idea of a of a central bank digital currency is to give the fed and you know by extension of the government complete control so if you imagine you know any dollar that you have having a microchip in it and it could be programmable and uh not only programmable in terms of where you can spend it and if it expires but that if you take it to the store it could be tied into anything oh I'm sorry Michelle you've eaten too many burgers this month you know we think that cows are bad for the environment so we're not going to let you spend here and so that is Central Bank currency is the ultimate I it's in the name it's centralized control and just because it's digital and maybe tokenized or associated with a blockchain you doesn't give it the same um principles as what is driving the movement behind Bitcoin and I think that's the scary part in all of this is that there's so much interest in what it is that decentralization can do but because the masses are not well informed and you know people know what a restaurant chain is and they know what a gold chain is but they don't necessarily know what a blockchain is and certainly not well enough to you know explain it and be intimately involved in in uh you know owning tokenized assets that it's hard for the average person to separate those and when you think about some of the tricks that could be used to get people to buy in NOP pun intended um to to a centralized currency whether it's a universal basic income whether it's the promise to control inflation because you know they won't tell anyone this but if they have the ability to turn currency on and off that's a really you know clear way for them to control demand um so you know there are definitely lots of different carrots that they can put out there even something as simple as oh you know trade in one of your dollars and you'll get you know 10,000 digital dollars and then all of a sudden people be like Oh I'm gonna be you know a digital dollar millionaire not realizing that it's about the purchasing power not about the headline you know amount and we've seen that over and over again that's you part of the the issue with the stimulus checks here in the United States which caus inflation so I think that's the concern that everybody needs to be thinking about when we hear about Tok organization of assets and we hear about Central Bank currencies we hear about cryptocurrencies this just this conflation about you know who has the ownership who has the freedom who has the insight into that and because it's new and it's you know confusing and and and sort of unchartered territory for a lot of people I fear that that's going to be taken advantage of in a very bad way right and Bitcoin is the complete antithesis of a central bank digital currency in that it is decentralized and is a response to the failures of the financial system as we saw after the 2008 financial crisis hence the the Genesis of Bitcoin but you bring up this point which you bring up in the book again that perhaps the central planners are using the confusion about what a digital currency is versus a cryptocurrency to try to capitalize and in the book I found this very interesting you you bring up the example of how in March of 2022 the Biden Administration put out an executive order on ensuring responsible development of digital assets which is really about a central bank digital currency it started off talking about cryptocurrencies broadly but then switched to cover policy and actions related to the United States Central Bank digital currencies which as we've just covered is the exact opposite of Bitcoin and decentralized currencies but let's expand more on this cbdc and again for our viewers as a recap that are not familiar this is a form of Fiat issued by a central bank it allows the government to program the currency as you pointed out to decide what transactions will or will not go through you bring up the meat example that's certainly one of my concerns I'll be told I've had too much stake for the month or I've taken too many too many flights and I've exceeded my carbon output so my currency won't work for that purchase or it work but with a big penalty right and under the guise of saving the planet uh it's also uh we've got the programmable aspect which we touched on and every transaction can be monitored so there's zero privacy zero anonymity making it so much easier for the government of the powers that be to cancel people if they don't like what they're doing and as you pointed out in the book we saw very concrete examples of government overreach during covid and you point out the example of the the truckers in Canada how they were effectively taken off the financial system when they protested against mandatory vaccines and how much it is so much easier to do that when you have a central bank digital currency and you can just click it so a little more on why a cbdc is such a giant threat to our freedoms why it it it may sound fine and here download a digital wallet and we'll give you you know digital dollars and and it's it's just the same as you've been using venmo or or in your bank because they may spin it but why is it not like that and why could it be such a slippery slope to a dystopian future I think Co is a good backdrop because you know people saw a lot of behaviors there but didn't maybe necessarily tie them into the concept of cancel culture or the financial implications there so we saw people who were ridiculed because you know you weren't wearing a mask and so you got your Social credits you know put out in a way where maybe people didn't want to do business with you or you um you didn't take a vaccine so you couldn't participate in the economy you couldn't you know uh go to restaurants or in some cases if you were you know a policeman or fireman you might have lost your job we saw them shut down businesses wholesale based not on data and science but based on political cloud and connection we know that the small businesses bore the brunt of that that I couldn't get my hair done at a small Salon but a dog could get their hair or fur I guess it is fixed and their nails done at a big box retailer down the street so if you have a government who is willing to you know push incentives and disincentives based on you know what it is that they want to do to affect change which we know they do that through taxes they do that through policy and now they did it through these crazy mandates in covid Imagine that they can do that now with the fruits of your labor because one of the things Michelle that people always forget is that money isn't sort of the promisory note or you know just a number in your bank account it's a proxy for your productivity it's what you have earned and they say this is a way for you to to take that what you have earned and to give you something that you can go out and trade for goods and services so you can't just you know all these people who want to just add more money to the system system well if you don't have an increase in productivity we know then there that has just basically um killed what it is that you have done in terms of productivity and just put more dollars out there chasing the the same amount of goods and services and so we don't see people thinking through that enough so imagine that now you have the fruits of your labor and not only can the government destroy it through their fiscal policy and their monetary policy but they actually can go into your bank account or at your point of sale when you're making a transaction and they can weigh in with their policies and their incentives and their disincentives at that point in time it takes away your privacy it takes away your agency it takes away your freedom and potentially if they wanted to since they're the ones that have put it out they can take it away and you may say well you know we've got a constitution to protect that okay well where are you coming up with the money to go through the court system to fight this from you know when it happens so it really is a really scary future I think it is the number one concern if you want to do something that's just going to completely destroy the foundation of the United States of America you bring in a central bank digital currency and it's just completely over and I think the people who are interested um you know in Bitcoin or in gold and silver and other uh physical medals as Hedges you know this is one of the biggest thesis and concerns that people have worked to accumulate you know some proxy for their productivity they've built up wealth and you know when they have it in a monetary form that they're worried that that can be co-opted entirely by the government and it is just the absolute most frightening thing for for freedom and wealth creation I couldn't agree with you more Carol that is certainly the issue that keeps me up at night because so much of our freedom is tied to our ability to use money freely and have that as a real representation of our time and effort and yes we've seen our currency devalued and debased but even so now we still have some control over it where we wouldn't if we have a central bank digital currency adopted and again this isn't some conspiracy because this is actively happening we have 134 countries exploring a cbdc uh 98% of global GDP uh just four years ago that was only 35 countries this is according to the Atlantic Council which is tracking this this isn't some you know Theory this was pioneered by The People's Bank of China which H should give us cause for concern in the first place and they've linked it into you know a social credit system potentially in in the future because they do have a very active social credit system there but anything that the People's Bank of China is pioneering should make you you know think twice in terms of losing freedom and control but this is a trend that is growing and it brings up the question of How likely are we to see one in the United States I mean so far we're being told oh it can't happen without Congressional approval and if we do get one it'll be wholesale and on retail you L explain why those are not any to make us feel better about the prospects here well I mean you've you've met the government before right and so you know yes they have said many times Jerome Powell has been you know quoted on the record by saying that they that we require Congressional approval to do this however you know I testified in front of a congressional committee I followed um Congress you can sneak a lot of things in there without anybody knowing I mean they get these bills that are you know thousands and thousands of pages where they have 20 minutes to to make a vote and stuff gets stuck in and snuck in in different ways so I think right now the most important thing we can do is to just stay on top of it make sure that your representatives know that this is a a giant no we have had some states that have done a really good job in terms of pushing back but part of the issue and it goes back to sophistication is you know the fed and anybody associated with Wall Street is much more sophisticated than anybody in the government and one of the big concerns that I have on top of all of the ones that we've talked about is that they will try to put forth something that tries to create a barrier that actually because of the way that it's written opens up the door for essential Bank digital currency and I think we've seen some um some legislation in the past that you caused some concern that hasn't moved forward but enough where you're going yeah these people don't know what it is that they're talking about so that's a big issue but but certainly if it benefits them to do so which we know it does and they get desperate which we know that there's you know cause for desperation I certainly think it is one of several things on the table that they could do and it will be up to us as the American people to make this you know it's important to educate people around you and it's important that as these things pop up that you use your voice one thing that I've learned and I am not a political activist I hate politics you know I'm a Problem Solver but not enough people call their representatives and their senators in the United States and the people who do actually if they're even just a handful of people it makes a difference because there's so few people do if you get 10 people call in an afternoon all of a sudden this is the biggest issue that they've heard about in weeks so it is really important that the people who are on top of these things and uh and see it coming down the pike keep very close watch and as soon as things are per percolating activate others to say absolutely not but Carol can the US not have a cbdc if every other country or major country does I mean I started off this interview with saying how the Swift system is moving to adopt cbdcs can the US be competitive as a superpower as the world leader if it does not have a c DC absolutely they can I mean they may not want to give up the power that it gives them internally but in terms of their role um in the in the world that's been one of the biggest arguments around it is that we have a very sophisticated well-functioning uh system of of exchanging currencies and we don't need a cbdc for all of the quote unquote reasons why other countries feel that they do in fact um you the fed put out a system I think it was you know Le started working on it you know maybe a year ago called fed now which a lot of people freaked out about and said oh no this is cbdc and it's like no this just just you know kind of the the plumbing of the financial system kind of like a wi transfer AC and because we have these other great systems we don't need to have a CBC cbdc in order to affect change so we're at The Cutting Edge of Technology thanks to our private sector thanks to you know the people we have um you know that are on top of things here and you know being sort of in that leadership position so if they do use that as the excuse know that it's entirely an excuse well you know who is a big champion of cbdcs the world economic Forum they're actually shockingly enough yeah they're they're putting out a handbooks uh and along with the IMF in order to help guide ministries of finance and Central bankers in how best to introduce cbc's big champions of Central Bank digital currencies at the world economic forum and you know you you you mentioned the world economic Forum you mentioned Tech uh you mentioned the elite the wealthy ones of our society and social credit scores and digital IDs and it all comes together if you look at how it's all part of the un's agenda for 2030 with where they say providing a legal identity for all and a digital public infrastructure is essential to achieve peace inclusivity and Justice so the United Nations the Bill and Melinda uh Gates Foundation and partners of the Rockefeller Foundation have recently launched their 50 and5 campaign to accelerate digital public infrastructure and the aim is to facilitate a digital ID digital payments like a central bank digital currency and data sharing rollouts in 50 countries in 5 years time uh so really creeping up on us and this is all again linked to them having your data them having a social credit system where they can grade you according to the data that they see a digital ID that's linked to that in one easy way to access you and then linked to a central bank digital currency and you you look at the Players here and you have to start to wonder how much of this is in fact coordinated right well well I mean just look at the date right why are all of these things 2030 why like why why is that the date for you know the top eight predictions were for 2030 it wasn't like it was in 2020 it was before that so why was that the date why are the UN you know sustainable development goals around 2030 why are all the climate goals around 2030 you know at some point you just have to go this doesn't seem like a coincidence anymore I said that before or with what the same names popping up like I'll give you a couple times but when when they're all running towards the same marker using similar language of course it seems entirely coordinated and you know the part that kills me is that it's always sold with the best intentions you know I shared a story in the book Michelle that you may remember a vintage Twilight Zone episode where you had these fantastic aliens who came down to earth and the people of Earth were very like what you know why are the aliens here and the aliens said well you know we saw that you have war and we saw you famine and we've got this great technology and we just want to help you out we're just here to help the people of Earth out and of course they're entirely skeptical because nobody just you know does things out of the goodness of their heart but they put the alien under a lie detector test and he passes with flying colors and the CIA group happens to get a copy of this this manual or book that he's got with him and they were able to decode the cover and the cover is to serve man and they said well you know that foots he said that they're here to help us he passed the LI detector they're here to serve man so they're just out of the goodness of their hearts they want to help us out so you know they use the technology it looks great it starts to work and then all of a sudden they're like well you know maybe the people of Earth want to come visit us and see what it's like on our planet and everyone's like oh that's great and they go up in the spaceship and one guy from the CIA is you know boarding the spaceship and it turns out his colleague has now cracked the code of the rest to the book and runs up and says it's a cookbook to serve man is a cookbook and I just you want to leave that with everybody that when they try to sell this as it's for the good of people the last time I saw something sold as the good of the people it was to serve man and that was a cookbook so you know right lot lots of quote unquote good intentions out there yeah how how to serve man as uh you know the dish right um you know with as as dinner with your with your favorite sauce no I remember that anecdote from the book and as I say that is what's so great about the book is that it really helps people understand uh these points in a very hard-hitting yet digestible pun intended way so uh an an an excellent read so let's wrap up with if we don't want to be served up as din know right to the aliens or to the elites or World economic Forum or Powers zepi what can we do I mean this agenda is underway certainly you know the the dollar life cycle part as you said we can't really fight against the FED we can't really fight against the United Nations we can call up our Congressman sure and say we don't like cbdcs but what can we really do as this financial World War f is approaching okay so if you've lived through the last 15 years that you know that when they have to uh you know use accommodative monetary policy print money and inflate away the debt that that tends to be very good for what for hard assets and so really every category of asset has benefited you know over the last 15E period so this is very boring Financial advice but you know now you get to see it through a different lens you have to own things they want you to own nothing I want you to own everything and that means a diversified portfolio it means having some equities it means having um some precious metals it means if you do own your own business that's great do the things that you can to protect that but really you know own a home do what you can so that you are participating in that inflation when it happens and not just seeing your cash being uh you know completely debased but that you have the assets to move along with it I think that's very important in terms of protection and then you know on the on the freedom side I do think we need more people and more V voices really pushing for a digital of Rights because as we've talked about over and over again the freedoms that are being eroded here and all these things that we're talking about um are pretty staggering and if we don't push back if we don't get those protected we're going to find ourselves in a world where the elites have everything and you know most of the population has nothing and it sounds very dystopian it sounds very ready player one right where everybody's living you know with these these goggles and these sort of dystopian reality is because the actual reality is is so ugly but that's you know kind of the trajectory that we're on that the people who are wealthy and well connected have done very well um you know they're they're getting wealthier they're owning more of the wealth and for everybody else that American Dream whether it's technically in America or somewhere around the world is slipping away and we cannot have people not have a purpose and not have that purpose be able to pay off for them so people need to be able to work and that work their productivity that that money that is exchanged as a proxy for their productivity has to be able to afford them to participate in the dream that they've worked hard for so that's it's you know it's not sexy it's not a hey this is a you know something that you haven't heard before it's just a new lens and a new sense of urgency and why you may have to be more auster in your spending and your lifestyle style for some period of time that delayed gratification in order to own more things and set yourself up for the future do you see Bitcoin as an asset that helps in this scenario granted I mean you mentioned gold you mentioned um hard assets some people would argue that Bitcoin is the digital version of gold that Bitcoin in its purest form is supposed to be the decentralized answer to everything that we've discussed about government manipulation of currency control devaluing of your work and assets debasement of your your currency that it is supposed to be a a unit of measure as agreed to by consensus by a network by a group of people I mean there there there issues with Bitcoin and government regulation still but do you potentially see Bitcoin as as another way to sort of protect yourself in this battle so I certainly think that Bitcoin is one of an the alternative assets that people should consider you know based on their own risk profiles based on whatever else that owns you know filling that role as a potential hedge you know a smaller part of you know the the riskier part that alternative asset piece of your portfolio um that being said personally I would say I am neutral on bitcoin I see the purpose I understand the argument I also have some concerns so I am neither a promoter or a detractor I understand it I accept it I think that there are a lot of people who are really smart and well informed on it and people should listen to them those arguments and then decide if it fits your own personal risk profile and has a place in your portfolio all right um I will say that you know I for one am a little concerned with the encroachment of traditional Finance into into the Bitcoin sphere with a like of the the Black Rock and institutional Finance launching the spot Bitcoin ETFs is a point I've raised before I think it may be contradictory to the ethos of Bitcoin although it may help you know the number go up but you know in the long run that is a concern that that I've raised um and again full disclosure to our viewers I own Bitcoin and I own gold so final thoughts here as we wrap up Carol yeah so I mean again just kind of putting a bow on all of this you people are struggling right now and I'm very empathetic to that you know we have lived through this incredible time when we are able to do better than our parents and our grandparents and for future Generations you know that is not shaping up to be the case and that can be very demoralizing but I think it's very important that people don't get sidetracked by the emotion and stay focused that there still is a path forward and it's not easy I'm not ping the fact that right now it's hard to pay for food and it's hard to make your rent but I would be doing everything if I was you know it 20 years younger 30 years younger right now similar to what I did when I was that age to be as austere as possible when when I started out in in my early 20s I had a 400 sqare foot Studio I had a cardboard box as my bedside table and I took every dollar that I could first paid down my debt and then you use that for investment and accumulating assets and so I think the idea of ownership is got to be something that you view through a different lens and an important lens because if you want to create wealth and you want to have personal sovereignty and freedom that comes to you through owning things through that ownership of assets that can retain their value and can increase in value so they may want you to own nothing but I want you to own as much as possible and then you will be happy own everything and be happy as opposed to owe nothing and be happy but thank you so much I do own the physical copy of this book and I do again recommend it to our readers we've touched on some of the issues but really there's tremendous nuggets as you go in depth in the book you will owe nothing Carol Roth really appreciate your time and your analysis today thank you thank you for having me and for doing such a a great thorough job and taking so much material and tying it together so seamlessly I really appreciate it thanks again Carol and before we wrap

[Music] so let's get your outlook on gold now because that's certainly what our viewers always interested in uh we had gold setting new record highs of above $2,400 an ounce it sort of settled into the 2,300 range do you have uh a gold outlook for 2024 I think for 2425 I see you know 3,000 in the cards for sure um near term if you look at the G and the percentage of the GLD is above which is a gold yeah the percentage of the GLD is above the 200 day moving average is pretty great um and so I just think near term you've had such a move that you're you're more likely to have a bit of a decline but over say the next year year and a half 33500 I I think it's it's it's it's it's a very high high probability 3500 gold a high probability by mid 2025 yes but remember your better bet would be in the the commodity Market's going to broaden out so if you're at $3,500 gold you probably you're probably close to 50 50 to $55 silver so your upside from Silver is is is a lot greater than gold that's exactly where I was going with this Larry because you are saying that silver is is the place to be you wrote in your latest report that the gold is silver ratio is breaking out in favor of silver which is a very bullish setup for Silvera so elaborate on that for us please well you know we know about we know about this solar demand for silver we know about all the industrial demand but central banks and investors around the world the first thing they do is move into the mothership they move into gold but the higher the gold price goes the cheaper the cheaper the more more attractive silver gets on a price basis so historically these types of big moves in Gold bring lots of global retail investors into silver and so that's one of the first things that that happens and we think that's that's about to happen um the the next part of it is once once the market knows that the FED is committed toward an official easing cycle that's where the money really starts to move into uh silver and so in other words if you look at 2016 where the FED made a really big shift uh even though we hiked that year they were promising uh seven or eight they're pricing like in 2016 15 16 they were promising like eight rate rate hikes and they hiped once since they made this huge shift in the silver miners dramatic and the silver itself dramatically out ofform gold in that kind of regime it's the same thing historically in the 70s and 80s so once the FED makes makes a strategic shift in where all the FED Governors are in unison talking about soft path that's where silver dramatically up up for gold and that's where this gold silver ratio is like an 84 85 handle it should be at a normal mature commodity Market it should be in the 60s to maybe mid vifs so what does that mean in terms of price for silver we had silver approach $30 an ounce in April back down to the $27 range uh keeping in mind that uh you know gold has hit new record highs this year several times silver is still very far off from its own all-time highs where do you see Silva going price-wise by the end of 2024 well I think by the end of 24 you get a good shot at 30 32 you know breakout we had this big draw down within the last month or so we look back at the beer traps at for we look back the last you know 20 30 years and at the beginning of these great bull runs in silver you typically have these beautiful candle tops uh many of them in other words it's the side of kind of like a lot of hot money as as the commodity Market broadens out the hot money moves from the capital moves from from gold and and other Commodities into silver and you get these kind of bursts up spectacular draw downs and then higher highs and U so that's that's I think and then we saw this like in early 2010 not 20 late 2010 early 2011 and so we think we're that kind of like 2010 late 2010 environment where silver has a long way to go on the upside do you have a price Target then well I mean I think within within say between now and 2025 26 you know $40 to $50 is is on is is on the table for us I mean just the supply silver relative to Gold um globally and and just the the cheapness as a percentage of in ter of global the amount of global wealth that's in $16 trillion dollar in gold right silver is a fraction of that and so all it takes is a trillion dollars to go from gold and silver and you've got there there's your there's your move from $10 to $40 pretty fast and Larry what is the best way for investors to get exposure to that silver uptrend that you're forecasting well the most conservative way would be like the SLV uh and then I think at the early stage of a buera you want to move into the Juniors so your SJ which is your s i LJ which is your Junior minors in the silver space well your panamerican your P your heck that those are your more speculative plays uh and then your s is a little bit larger silver companies so more conservative way to play it is is through the ETFs for sure and then you know if you're a professional investor you look at Silver Futures in the in the Futures Market or you know you look at funds like green light capital and let David Einhorn you know buy the commodities for you all right so you're very long silver you're also long gold but I want to bring it back to what you said at the top and that is platinum because in your latest report you wrote take down your GLD old long exposure and buy Platinum uh tell us why you're so confident that the Platinum versus gold trade is is where to go well that ratio the go this is the classic people moving it to the mother ship all the central Bankers have P piled in the gold because that term premium on Treasury that's the ter all term premium means is that when people trust longer dated treasuries less when the United States becomes just a tiny tiny bit like an Emerging Market country in terms of people are looking what's happening in Washington and they trust Washington just a little bit less that a term premium expansion which was seen term premium U will move money into um into into the medals and so that that's what that's what kicks it off and and so the the the the the Platinum space is so small relative to Gold we're talking about a lipic size swimming pool that's the equivalent of all the gold that's ever been mind in the world Platinum you can sit you can stand in that pool only up to your ankles as I mentioned before but also the last 18 to 24 months we saw this big huge high-profile uh sales pitch about electric vehicles and what's starting to happen now is the repair cost on electric vehicles the operational cost the reality of owning electric vehicle versus a hybrid that's now becoming much more well the awareness around that pain for the consumer is much higher now extremely sort like an explosion of hybrid awareness Rel relative to electric vehicles that's why we're seeing the performance of of Tesla is suffered and so what that means is if that whole life cycle that rush into electric vehicles if that is delayed by 10 years into a move into hybrids and we're seeing this in some of the Japanese car makers that means that your catalytic converters and and your truly I said before your industrial demand for platinum and padium is going to be around a lot longer as the market kind of picks up on this trend your upside for platinum and padium is spectacular and your gold versus silver I'm sorry your gold versus platinum ratio is at a examing bip plaum cell Sil gold range right now it's EXT the most stretch we've ever seen in the history of the relationship but that's a near-term play Larry right as I you're saying we are seeing some disenchantment with electric vehicles and more hybrid vehicles and bringing in more industrial uses for platinum but then you know a big picture one of the cases that you make for silver and copper is this whole uh de carbonization Trend so how does you know Platinum fit into that thesis a couple of years down the line then yeah that's that that is a problem for platinum and people say you know hydrogen um in the case of aluminum aluminum will truly be uh a cost replacement for uh for for copper and so that's where you your bull case for Alcoa is is pretty interesting but but you're right that that whole EV risk if if electric if electric vehicle demand truly explodes and hybrid hybrids Fall by the wayside that's a big problem in terms of catalytic convert demand So eventually things like green hydrogen and other Technologies are going to come on and that's your your your your your platinum demand platinum's a very heat resistant metal so that's why with catalytic inverters uh there's there's such a tremendous demand for platinum padium and with green hydrogen if you think of like if you think of like Caterpillar you think of like all of these enormous pieces of equipment globally that are run on diesel fuel you think about 20 years from now 10 years from now those being potentially hydrogen powered uh vehicles and or big huge Earth moving machines that move from diesel to hydrogen that or big buses this is going to create a whole new demand set for platinum plaum that is uh that will be factored in over the law so given all of this and given the thesis that you've laid out for us Larry how should a portfolio be structured now in terms of percentage allocations what what are you looking at and for which timeline well one of the things we talk talked about in the book when Market speak is that uh your 640 portfolio of traditional stocks versus bonds is is is basic basically de and so that's from that's a 2010 to 2020 deflationary regime portfolio um now we're in a 40 4020 uh portfolio where you want to be 40% stocks 40% bonds 20% Commodities within that commodity bucket you want to be in right at this stage you want be pretty heavy in uh in what we call Precious Metals and pgms um and as The Cutting cycle starts to take hold and where we kind of go into a economic slowdown then start to come out then you want to start to be uh really over allocating toward oil uh gas and copper and that's where you're going to get the real economic upside in terms of in terms of like your your S&P 500 remember 1980 the last commodity bull market with a multi-polar world 49% of the P was in Industrials oil and gas and materials 49% today that's close to 12 13 maybe 14% the last six months so we see that growing from say say 13 to 14% up to 30% so we're going to see within the next five or 10 years your bhps your Rio tinos Your Valet are going to be a much larger percentage of the market you know your Chevrons your exons your is your Marathon petroleums so you're looking for those parts of the market are going to that part of the market probably at least double in terms of its composition component of the of the S&P 500 that's an Industrials oil and gas metals and materials [Music]

hey everyone I'm Jeremy saffron this is kod news don't forget to subscribe for the latest market analysis well today on the show silver is making headlines again recently reaching its highest level since December 2012 at around $31.50 us now the surge is driven by robust industrial demand particularly from green technologies and the expectations of the FED to cut interest rates later this year analysts from JP Morgan and predict silver could potentially reach $35 us per ounce by the end of 2024 highlighting a bullish outlook for the metal even though today we're seeing a little bit of profit taking in the resistance around the $32 level so why does this matter well Silver's rise isn't just a market anomaly Global silver demand is forecasted to hit 1.2 billion ounces in 2024 alone and that would be the second highest level on record indicating strong and sustained demand and on the supply side the market is expected to remain in deficit for the four consecutive year despite a projected 4% increase in mine output and this ongoing supply and demand imbalance is creating a very supportive environment for higher silver prices let's break it all down and welcome back our friend Bill baroo he's the president of Blue Line Futures and his season technical Trader renowned for his expertise in Commodities and the precious metals Market hey Bill welcome back on the show thank you for that introduction it's a pleasure to join you so Bill Let's uh let's rewind here I just talked a little bit about the those silver prices they recently reached their highest level since December 2012 you know given this Surge and given what we're seeing today help us make sense of it and and give us your short-term and long-term forecast on silver prices if you could the fact alone that that silver has gotten above $30 a ceiling that we've seen you know amid exuberance um go back to the to the pandemic I mean it's uh seeing it above $30 I think is a big feat and now we just got to hold it I think there's as you mentioned Commodities are under a little bit of pressure here today um what really matters is a constructive path I mean there's going to be profit taking and there's going to be swings lower there's going to be news headlines and there's going to be different things that that uh become headwinds uh as this journey continues for silver but as long as it it stays above $30 I we what we want to see is it build a new base and then use that base you mentioned some have a target of $35 out there and that is a big technical Target if we could base out above 30 broadly speaking I I think $35 should be in the cards yeah well let's talk let's unpack that a little bit I mean those are the analysts from JP Morgan I think they came out they said hey this could potentially reach $35 per ounce by the end of the year you you look at the markets today I know we can't push quite past that resistance level but is this a lowball number or are we going to is this could this be even higher than that 35 listen if you if you really back out the truck and you look at what you know some of these different Commodities have done Coco for for instance I mean you gold has had had an incredible move as well uh and and silver is known to have more volatility than gold but if you look at some what some of these Commodities have done and how suppressed for for since the 2011 High I mean it's been this is this move has been a decade in the making um I mean yeah we should we should be able to move out above 35 what what would say we can't get to 40 what would say we can't get to 50 and what would say I mean with with growing demand growing narrative and this becoming a mainstream move what's it say that we couldn't get to $70 listen I I think anything is really in the cards here and you know we we work with a wide range of clients I me our team at Blue Line Futures know some people just want to have silver exposure and if that's you out there silver exposure you know there there's a that's where you're looking at it staying above $30 in the near term others want to trade it when I'm doing at Blue Creek capital my commodity fund um you know I'm trying to manage my downside here and and capture all the upside uh and and I'm more active in trading this I'm looking at more shorter term targets and saying okay now 3275 is a bit of a resistance level that we've tested a couple times and if we don't get out above it looking at yesterday if we didn't get out above it now you know we're likely to get away for profit taking so you prepare for some of these more little little moves these micro moves within the within the market yeah it's an interesting trade and and you know as you mentioned Silver's been testing support around that $30 Mark resistance around 32 maybe just past it but you know you're a technical traders so I'm curious with technical indicators such as the RSI you know the relative strength index the moving averages it seems that we're seeing some bullish Trends here how confident are you in a breakout above these levels and and what indicators do you consider most reliable when you're looking at your trades listen silver I've always looked at as the higher volatility of the metals complex as well the one that becomes a follower of sorts before it finally takes the lead and you look at gold you have to talk about gold if you're talking about silver and some of the projections I have for gold would say gold can get the 2790 now we haven't even had the First Fed rate cut this year but on average within 30 days or 60 sorry 30 maybe 60 days within the F fed's First Rate cut gold is averaged a 6% gain so I I mean gold maybe is front running a little bit but we're seeing rate Cuts as the year evolves kind of fall off a bit and um gold is Contin to do very well due to fiscal policy due to geopolitical uh as well as demand from the bricks Brazil Russia India China of course which has just hit their 18th straight month of expanding their gold reserves although at a lower Pace uh in South Africa so I mean I think there's a tremendous amount of gold demand out there uh and then you have copper which just set a record high and I mean there there are commodity Traders commodity investors that that I I've looked up to for many years that have put out targets with copper with two digits above $10 so when you look at the expanding industrial cases that you've talked about with silver you look at what's driving gold then you look at further with copper what's going on with data centers um and and then maybe China coming back online and being a big Catalyst as well um they're improving economy you know silver I I think has two major Tailwinds here and I think that's that's really why when I take a step back and I look at it I'm not not so just trading and and trying to manage my my risk and and my in my commodity fund but saying okay if you are if you want to be long silver this breakout above 30s is extremely significant because of all these Tailwinds that are still here to play out out and as long as it can say above 30 from a technical basis this is a breakout this is a a decade long breakout that has played out and is playing out now and as long as it hold above 30 um I think the the path lease resistance remains higher to 35 to 40 to $50 or more maybe yeah a lot of people would be very very happy to see a $50 silver let's talk about those Tailwinds a little bit Bill break them down a little bit for the audience because you know you mentioned gold and we'll get to gold in a second but you know ETFs on the silver side are seeing similar inflow and there's strong demand for the retail investors obviously it's less costs than than silver what's the impact here and and how long are we going to see this sustained I mean this could be a new regime I mean it's it's a it's a commodity super cycle and as I mentioned it's not just gold and silver and and copper I mean there's you look at cocoa and and some movies we've seen in coffee and other Commodities out there has have been really tremendous I think we are in a commodity super cycle and this is the aftermath of of you know if you look at Commodities the the the demand that's coming out of the pandemic um different different supply chain disruptions I others that are affected geopolitical issues that and and local uh political issues that affect some of these Commodities as well um so when you take a look at I I think you have to look at Silver I mean just narrowing it down looking at Gold um as I mentioned the the bricks the which is Brazil Russia India China in South Africa um I mean they there is a new geopolitical regime that's being developed I mean you're seeing with with the War Russia the Russian war in Ukraine I mean what's taking place there the geopolitics that have taken place uh with with Israel surrounding surrounding with Gaza surrounding with with with what's going with Iran I mean there there is an everpresent heightened uh geopolitical tension that's continuing to go and uh and as I mentioned with China's China's Central Bank buying tied to that China's they're they are allies of China when you're looking at Iran you're looking at at Russia and um so the regime that's being developed here is is attempting to move away from the US dollar um so I think that that's the importance here as they as they expand their gold reserves this is potentially just the beginning and so if you take that Tailwind you look at what's taking place as well in the industrial side um the onshoring you know we're investing into semiconductors and and uh being able to uh build those domestically I mean the amount of money that's being put put into that I mean not only that that's that's fiscal policy printing more money degrading the dollar there is a lot of Tailwinds that are developing here if you just sort of just got of you pick your poison what is the Catalyst what is the Tailwind here so my my only question is you know why did it take so long for silver and I I think it's uh and that's the fact that it has taken so long is is why this is such a big feat and why it's so critical for it to stay above $30 yeah I mean some keep people calling it The Perfect Storm I mean let's talk about the supply side issues here the silver markets faced Supply deficits for four consecutive years obviously supporting higher prices despite that varied investment demand but you know major producers like Mexico per they face potential disruptions when you look at these Investments when you're looking at the market how do you mitigate risk what are you monitoring in terms of that risk here listen I mean there there has been uh production disruptions that have taken place in Mexico and in South South America and I think that that is something that has been a catalyst and you've look at U copper specifically I mean they they can and again you're not to not to move away from Silver but these are Tailwinds that are pulling silver as well when when copper is performing sort of silver you look at Copper the the issue I mean the smelters have have cut down U actually creating the finished product of of copper because they couldn't get the the raw material and then basically the the CP the premium the refin which is essentially sort of what goes into refining copper traded at negative so these these uh smelters I mean they're they are potentially losing money I you would think that mining would bring back on more more supply of of copper maybe it's it's bit more scarce maybe the input costs of these mining companies making more difficult at the same time these mining companies have had uh have had suppressed prices suppressed earnings have carried a ton of debt for many years so as interest rate Rose these mining companies they didn't follow um even the small improvements you saw in in the the underlying price as well as just the broader Market over the last couple of years this is their time to shine so I mean ultimately I I don't the same way you look at the the energy companies um that in 2021 um these energy companies in 2021 would crude oil finally got above $70 they were still underperforming significantly it took it took a bit of time for at all to be baked in so you know I I think there's just again a number of Tailwinds here in the industry uh that has just has had a lot of headwinds and has been suppressed for for quite a while so um this is again I just keep coming back how exciting this is to finally see yeah no it's exciting I mean we keep watching it I mean go back to Gold for a second it's obviously set several new all-time highs this year but Silver's record highs are still far off so I mean you know there's a Divergent here but how soon could we maybe see new record highs in silver and what kind of environment is it going to take yeah what we're actually seeing from relative to Gold um if you go back you know the the gold silver ratio if you go back to the the strength that we saw coming out of the pandemic uh and and in some of the Commodities silver um outperformed gold for a period of time and that would put a low essentially in that ratio and that ratio has had higher lows since that 2021 bottom meaning gold has outperformed silver continuously I mean of course there was spurts of of movement in and silver that that may have highlighted our performance for a small period of time but broadly speaking this was a very well-defined uptrend meaning gold continued to outperform Silver a very well- defined trend line and in this past week it finally broke this it it the the moveing silver finally broke this uptrend now it's it is breaking down meaning silver is now outperforming gold uh and they that trend line was broken at 82 at a ratio and and it's now at 70 so what you know sort of once once the lid comes off I mean that that's kind of what we're we're hoping for here I mean managing your risk and that's why you know as a as you know I managed my fund at Blue Creek Capital Management it's it's managing this risk ever presently I mean there's continuous different news flows that could be headwinds and just just last night we had news that China is is going to uh potentially increase tariffs uh on Imports of us and EU cars to 25% you know copper has been pummeled here here on on this Wednesday Wednesday it's been it's been a brutal day for copper so there are always going to be surprises so so when I manage my risk when I manage things I I I utilize put spreads and puts I utilize stops I I try to you know look for well- defined technical entry points take on a little more risk that I can keep tight leash on while all trading and keeping around a core position of of silver and gold and other medals that keep in the portfolio yeah talk to me a little bit about copper here bill because as you mentioned we seen a little bit of a uh a kick in the butt on prices today but other medals are moving here so when you look at something like this are you looking long-term or you looking for a short short trade you know I I I think this downside is is definitely a a big ShakeOut and I mean it could last longer than than you know the Bulls are comfortable and that's what I'm being prepared for right now um but I I think again this is a commodity super cycle and and it's really been sort of a Domino's fall falling uh you got gold made the move copper made the move silver made the move and you know platinum and padium which which are also significantly under supplied and they're going to get Tighter and Tighter here in the coming year or two um have have really underperformed in in the in the recent uh recent move so I would I would think that we could see something from from uh platinum and plaum in the you know the next few months before this end of the year I'm I'm also involved in in aluminum I mean when you when you hear about copper involved in data centers aluminum is also a Catal you know data centers are also utilize aluminum too and aluminum's performed a bit better than platinum and plaum and has had quite a bit of a move of late but it's still it's still under undervalued relative to the some of the all-time highs that had seen right and you know we've seen that volatility even within the silver space and the EV Market talking a little bit about those Metals we see ev demand go down and of course copper gets hit a little bit talk to me though about platinum and padium because the catalytic converters when we talk about hybrid cards they're really not going away so is this one next yeah I mean I I am a believer in uh you know in the hybrid as as something that's going to be continued to um you know be more dominant you know listen I run a registered investment adviser run a run a wealth portfolio um company as well called Blue Line capital and yet we own Tesla in there it's not a major position but you know people ask me you know are you a believer in and uh you know full fley EV um you know and you know so overall um I'm not I mean I'm not somebody that thinks that 20 to 30 years from now that that we're going to go all EV every car you drive out there is going to be EV that that's not what I believe and I do believe that hybrids G become more more more prominent um you know I think it's G to take a while I think petroleum you know runs the world and you know if we're not going to move away from petroleum and that's that's something that people have to come to terms with um you know at the end of the day though you know I think the fact that hybrids are going to be more relevant than forecasted a year ago and two years ago because of the because of the projections of governments using uh pushing towards EVS that could be a catalyst and it takes time for bigger or larger narratives to to play out so it does get me excited for platinum and plaum in in the coming months the coming year or two yeah bill you talked a little bit about Tesla when you talk about your fund before I let you go here I give our audience maybe a couple of takes on the equity side is there anything you're watching in this market that might be a really good trade here in the next while well it's really tough to say I mean so so we're recording this uh Wednesday Wednesday afternoon we set the FED minutes out and in about two hours we're going to have uh Nvidia it's going to report now I'm a Believer all all roads lead to envidia you you look at the uh it's one of our top Holdings and uh but you know you never know what you get from this earnings report although I'm pretty optimistic about it um at the end of the day uh you see these hyperscalers you know they're spending you know a ton of money uh on investing in AI um one of the ones that I I love that hasn't spent a lot and hasn't come out with with a ton on the AI side just is Apple we're starting to see some some news trickle out but the spending is continuing to increase and and it's going to Nvidia so that's something to keep it keep an eye on uh as they need more gpus and as as AI becomes more relevant that leads back to Copper leads back to Copper leads back to aluminum those are Tailwinds for silver so it's just one big circle it really is and uh you know I think that's that's the way got to look at it there's so much you know rather than giving giving you a trade Right Here Right Now the the idea is is it's uh this world and the demand that we see of Commodities and what these what these companies are doing it's much more intertwined than you may think yeah it almost feels like people are just now getting educated on the energy front when it comes to EVS things like this that you know we're not transitioning that quick and there's still a long ways to go with this this transition yeah yeah I I mean I think it's it's quite a it's the transition's taking place a bit I mean I think there's there's going to be a lot of hurdles like I said I I don't think we're going to see a a transition to the degree that that people people are expecting it's going to be now it's going to be a a hybrid transition that that that's what we're looking for uh and you know it's G to take a lot longer than people expect a lot longer hopefully good for plat too hey thanks bud uh Bill baroo coming on president of Blue Line Futures joining us today I appreciate your Insight onto this uh best of luck hopefully tomorrow's a good day yeah yeah hope you finish the this is just a little ShakeOut the medals love to do it manage your risk if you're involved um you know at the Futures that's what we help clients do yeah and Everyone likes to take a little profit it's healthy yeah it's true I appreciate it thanks so much I'm jery

[Music] hello everyone Greg Diamond here editor of 10 Stock Trader at Sansbury research uh this is another edition of diamonds Edge video and um before I get started this week this is going to be an important week Nvidia earnings uh with this is with back with stocks back at new all-time highs uh or the indexes rather um but I have a plan regardless uh regardless of what you know we have more inflation data to regardless of inflation data regardless of Nvidia earnings um I have a plan for what to do over the next call a week or two um so check out the link below uh check out the URL uh for a new report that I just put together a new video uh explaining some of the well details of 10 Stock Trader but also what what I expect going forward and um for new subscribers who sign up and obviously current subscribers um I put together a new report as well as a new masterclass video and these detail both kind of the short-term setups looking for both in Nvidia and the semiconductor sector uh but also more long-term Gan cycles and how that plays out for the rest of 2024 so I think you'll like it again check out the link below uh for more information and this week I'm also going to cover something that you know maybe not a lot of investors are focused on um although they should be focused on obviously Nvidia and inflation and and the rest of it but uh let's turn to uh what I have on the screen here and this is a screenshot I took last week uh from Bloomberg and basically according to nedis Ned Davis research hedge funds are have one of their biggest net short positions on in the Russell 2000s okay so the pain trade here and what I mean by the pain trade is that what's going to hurt the most people what's going to cause the most pain if hedge funds have a record net short position higher prices are going to force them um to close that out as that will be painful because I'll lose a lot of money all right so this is the fun fundamental Catalyst or fundamental backdrop based upon positioning now let's look at the technicals okay so this is a chart of iwm I shares Russell 2000 which obviously tracks the um Russell 2000 Futures Contract all right and I've labeled here U just a simple from this April 19th Panic low 1 2 3 4 5 for a possible big wave one high all right and now if we get this correction over the next week or two and some of this will depend upon Nvidia maybe but definitely inflation um in interest rates okay so let's say interest rates bump up a little bit but we get this correction maybe it's steep you know down to this um 200ish level I noted this Gap here in purple okay as you can see this would be a correction so if I see this correct and then we start to Rally up again this is likely telling me that we're in breakout mode okay this could be a huge wave two wave three type of um Elliot wave move uh I've noted here um June 14th to June 21st be mindful of those dates um this would be maybe a short-term Reflection Point it's possible that we see you know a kind of a bigger correction and I'll show you what that might look like um you know it's possible we do something like this okay and then correct and then we get the big move up I'm that's that is you know a scenario that I'm considering but either way understand that the net Futures short position from hedge funds um in addition to we've already seen you know major indexes at new all-time highs a Russell 2000 finally catch up the technical Picture Tells Me it does as long as the 190 holds okay you know I see some type of one of these two scenarios where we get this low you know whether it's um later this week or early next week or then maybe into mid June you know that's going to be a situation to buy call options that's going to be a situation to establish a core position I like as I like to call it with um 3x leverage ETFs okay um so in addition to Nvidia in addition to inflation check out what's happening in terms of the price action regarding the Russell 2000 I really think this is going to be an important morget to watch over the next few months all right thank you very much I'll see you next time [Music]

[Music] hello everyone Greg Diamond here editor of 10 Stock Trader of sandbury research and this week's video I am going to look at interest rates as it relates to the stock market we have a big week this week with PPI CPI uh and you know this is going to determine largely what happens with the Federal Reserve but you know I'm looking at it more from a technical perspective uh as a road mapap for in for inflation interest rates and then in turn what the stock market is going to do so let's jump into it and this is a chart of the 10year US interest rate okay and I want to go back to basically I have three scenarios that I'm Lo watching over the next couple weeks okay so I want to go back to last year you know interest rates topped out here as you can see and then uh we just had this huge move down and this resulted in a large rally in the stock market makes sense trades go down stocks go up simple as that okay now now from the start of this year you know interest rates have ra broadly rallied okay um and we can see here obviously into late April you know we had this low or high interest R rather and then stocks kind of panicked you know and now we've we've kind of moved back up so the question now here is as you can see we've traded back down to support all right so I again I have three scenarios here unfolding number one is this green line that just breaks this support and we have a similar move probably won't be exactly the same but a similar move down in interest rates that results in a higher move in stocks simple as that okay now where it gets a little bit tricky is we'll have a little bit more volatility the blue line is you know a bounce a bounce over the next week or two you know fails to make a new high and then then we drop again um and you know maybe this doesn't drop but you know it drops into here and then we're get in rally and then eventually it does drop all right and then same thing with uh this red line is is you know higher readings higher inflation or or higher uh jobs number whatever it might be uh fed speak who knows okay I'm not going to sit here and tell you exactly what the inflation numbers are going to be it's not what I do okay I look at this based on the probabilities we don't deal in certainty um but price tends to show us ahead what's going to happen so I'm looking at these scenarios as the probabilities of what could happen so these are the three probabilities that I see uh based on and based on other technical factors and I'll relate that to the S&P 500 as well in a second all right so the red line is a little bit different this is where we get a little bit more volatility we trade right back up into resistance you know and then we kind of have another breakdown all right uh now this is the tenure I also want to show you uh the 2-year index so this is a shorter shorter interest rate um chart okay but what I really like about this chart is um sort of the technical factors that go into it so from the top here I've labeled what appears to be a very a near perfect or textbook rather um 1 2 3 4 5 down in interest rates and now what we have is looking like like a correction off to this low in an ABC all right and you can see these blue boxes are symmetrical move basically what that means is that this move um equals this move so the a-wave is very close to or near equal to the c-wave you know and then we had this big breakdown all right so again similar to the 10year you know am I looking at where this just simply trades lower because we as you can see here we actually broke below support or does it try to you know get another rally here um but this would be something where you know it's a false breakout and then we have a huge move down so if we have this breakdown in interest rates that's going to be very good for the stock market okay so let's look at that relative to the S&P 500 all right and again these are just three scenarios that I have so if you think about what I outlined in the 10-year interest rate we're going to um put that into the S&P 500 okay and again so this is the green um you know the green situation where interest rates bottom here in October and obviously stocks rallied you can see how we had this RSI that was oversold all right is this a similar situation from last year it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be the exact same but we had this oversold level into the low in April 19th okay that was kind of a panic selling and since then we've rallied all right so I can't rule out the fact that you know we have this similar situation in green where stocks just continue to grind higher um if those interest rates start to decline again it's really quite simple all right all right now let's look at at um other potential scenarios again this is the blue where it kind of gets a little choppy maybe interest rates bounce a little bit we see some volatility in stock market all right but it doesn't make a new low and we just kind of get another grinding rally what's what's also interesting is this red line all right and this would be extreme volatility okay it would probably freak A lot of people out but I still view it as bullish and here's why okay so let's say we get a new high okay and this rallies up here and then you know interest rates or whatever might be maybe Nvidia earnings okay um next week you know and this kind of Spooks the market well essentially what's that what that is going to do from my perspective is it's going to let's say this happens all right and we're looking at a situation where yeah you're actually falling into long-term support within the stock market and I would not be surprised if we saw so let's say that we that red line does um play out and we have this move back down below 5,000 you know maybe into the 4,800 level this is a very big Fibonacci Confluence zone of support so essentially what this would be is something where we would have an ABC and then rally again so that would be something that I would look for actually to get EXT very aggressive with call options okay um and I've been looking at various U stocks and ETFs to trade for uh 10 Stock Trader subscribers um we've had multiple game plans coming up and I think this is or over the last week I'm going to have even more over the next week or two because I really believe this is going to be an important inflection point uh call it a may surprise if you if you will um but I'm looking at this from a bullish perspective but also taking into account how interest rates are going to reflect into the stock market so that's what I'm looking for this week one of those three scenarios um and I will see you next week thank you very much [Music]

the FED wants you to believe they've got inflation under control but I believe we've only seen the beginning of a devastating new crisis and if you don't prepare now you could see your savings evaporate as inflation and interest rates sore even higher over the next two years it all traces back to a golden thread that ties together the biggest Financial calamities in America's history but it seems the entire Financial world is falling into this very same denial trap that led to massive Devastation the last time this crisis played out if you know your history you know there will be winners and losers and now is when you decide which one you'll be I've spelled it all out in an urgent new report go to www. bankr 2024 comom to get your free copy I'll also show you how to get my complete playbook for navigating this crisis including the three critical steps to take immediately again that's www. bankr 202 4.com for your free copy of my new [Music] [Applause] [Music] report Lyn Alden welcome to the show really glad you could be here thanks for having me oh you bet um so I really I was curious to get you on the show because I follow you on Twitter and I I enjoy enjoy doing so um and I have um lately become more interested in macro concerns than I was when I was you know years ago I started as a sort of bottomup one stock at a time kind of a guy and um so you're one of my favorite people to follow to do that um but you're new on the show actually so let's let's Orient our listeners a little bit and and tell them a little bit about you um to me you're like you're a macro investor like if I had to characterize you with one label that's the one I'd throw on you is that fair uh yeah I think that's I mean that's that's what probably my my biggest audience is or what I'm known for um like you I went through a similar process where I actually was more initially interested in equities uh individual equities um but it was by around 2017 or 2018 that I realized that the macro component was likely going to be a lot larger in the coming years than individual Equity selection um and so that that really started drawing my attention um and I guess the I mean the full background is basically that I started out in engineering actually um then went into Engineering Management engineering Finance um and so I I take a systems engineering approach to a lot of things which is basically you know in in systems engineering you designing or overseeing something that's more complex than any one person knows how it works for example uh you know I used to work with aircraft simulators and there's there's electrical there's mechanical there's software there's Aerospace code there's individual avionics no one person knows every component in the simulator but we have to somehow come together build it uh and then be able to troubleshoot it or operate and know how it works um and so it kind of comes down to control logic understanding the inputs the outputs the governing logic that happens in between and I I approach macro the same way which is basically that we have these monetary systems that were built they're essentially engineered systems um they they were constructed a certain way they work a certain way they have certain failure modes and then certain responses to those failure modes there's inputs there's outputs there's governing logic um and so I I really kind of study macro through a system engineering lens um and so that that's really what I've shifted to over the past several years ever since around that 2017 2018 period um I've really kind of focused uh on those topics all right so that's interesting to me it's interesting to me that it there was a conscious decision on your part that macro was going to become more important you know most people say well this just felt right and you know it was it attracted me or it's what I studied in school or something but uh I think that's really interesting so what what do you see what what did you see and and maybe still see in the world that tells you you know something um it's it's not good enough to be an equities dude anymore I got to get out there and and be a macro person so what I saw was that the US uh deficit as a percentage of GDP was rising at a time when we were not in a recession and unemployment rate was still going down uh and that had not happened since the Vietnam War uh and back then it only happened temporarily and so really you know before that it happened back in like the 40s for example um this was a unusual macro phenomenon and it led me to kind of do more research on you know I always had the big question like how how does so we're building up all this debt in the system higher and higher debt um and everyone says well it's not an issue now but one day it's going to be an issue so my question was well when is that one day coming uh when it's an issue how does it manifest as an issue um how are there periods in the past where they had this type of problem obviously not going to be exactly the same thing but are there types of of ways they ran into this head this issue and how do they address it and so when I saw that deficit starting to rise even when unemployment was falling I was like I think we're entering the early stages where some of this actually starts to matter um and so I that that kind of went down a whole Rabbit Hole of monetary history research how do they handle debts in the past um the difference between say fiscal dominance and monetary dominance and so even the big macro themes that I focus on today like the impact of of the fiscal side um really kind of started my interest in that started back in that kind of 2017 period because that's when that Trend initially emerged and it took time to gather Steam and become a larger and larger component in macro um but now that we're you know seven years into that situation I think it's continued to to manifest and strengthen so that's really the the the key thing that I think madebe have a conscious decision to say there are things happening here that I have to understand because they're going to if I do individual stocks these other things are going to push push them around they're not going to necessarily behave as they you know any sort of like say 30 40 or back test um for for things like this I think we're in a different environment where there's other things you want to be aware of because you know I still do individual stock analysis to varying extents um because they help inform the macro um sure but but I have to always analyze them with the macro in mind at least the way that I that that I do it so what really excites me is to find something in common um with a guest and the fact that you that you picked out 2017 just now 2017 changed things for me too that was when I started getting that's actually it was May 2017 specifically in my newsletter I was writing about how you know Animal Spirits basically to sum it up um were were in charge to too great an extent ENT of course um you know that that continued for for a while but um something definitely did change and like in particular if you look at something like cape ratio it spent a lot of time in what I would call kind of expensive bubbly even Mega bubbly territory since then um which you know augur poorly for for future returns um so right now um you know when I read your stuff and hear you talk this issue that you mentioned of fiscal dominance comes up why don't we get into that a little bit and explain what it means to our listener and why it's important to you sure so fiscal dominance is when the the fiscal deficit and and and federal debts or in in another country a sovereign debt when those are large enough that they start reducing the options that a central bank has um that it kind of can strin their options and the fiscal side becomes a more important impact on the economy than the monetary side uh and so as an example back in the 1970s it was an example of not being in fiscal dominance so if you look at where new money was coming from more money creation was happening from the private sector Bank lending and corporate bond issuance than from um uh deficits even though deficits were a a background issue as well there's just quantifiably more uh money creation coming from it was Bank lending um and federal debt was very low it was 30% uh to GDP and so a way to slow down that inflation was what vulker did which is raise interest rate Super High um slow down the rate of Bank lending put the economy into a recession um and that helped cool off the inflation it also I mean there's even the darker side which is basically it it it put Latin America to a depression because they had all these dollar Domin debts uh put them into a depression so they they consume less oil which is it impacts the supply demand balance but there's all sorts of reasons why that worked but basically the the interest expense of the federal government did increase because of all that higher rates but the when when 30% of De of GDP pays more interest out that is a you know that's less of an impact than all the the slowing that that did on the the private sector lending and so that was an example of you're in monetary dominance so there are monetary solutions to the mon to the monetary problems that are happening when we fast forward to what's what's happening today what what say Powell's dealing with is there's 120% that the GDP or about 100% held by the public um and there's the the federal deficit is larger than the sum of new bank loans and new corporate bond issuance in a given year um and that's that was not the case back then it's it's the case now at least in most years um and so when they when they try to when they run into inflation you know inflation did not happen this decade because of excessive Bank lending there's not a not a high rate of Bank lending it's kind of a modest rate of Bank lending uh instead it happened because there were very large monetized fiscal deficits uh and then various bottlenecks as those deficits kind of worked their way through the system and right now when there's still high inflation and and back especially when it was higher the FED raised rates uh to try to uh deal with that inflation but the problem is that most of it's not coming from excessive Bank lending most of it's coming from very large fiscal deficits and high indust rates are not really going to change what the deficits are doing and when you increase indust rates at a time when you have 100% de the GDP held by the public uh you actually increase those deficits even more than the rate that you slow down Bank lending um and so although the higher rates did have a downward you know disinflationary effect on the private sector money creation uh the the impact it did on the federal side is is kind of equal or bigger and so industr started having a more mixed result in dealing with inflation on one hand they are recessionary and disinflationary when you raise them the other hand they're actually stimulatory if you're if you're if you're owning money markets every time the FED raises rates you get a raise um if you're xon mobile you have long-term debt locked in and you have cash equivalence on your balance sheet so you get a raise uh a lot of corporations that get a raise every time the Federal Reserve increases interest rates and that was not the case in 70s that was not the case uh in certain other periods and so basically there's there's just kind of interesting Dynamics at play uh when a country gets about over 100% Deb to GDP and then especially when they also have unresolved fiscal imbalances and of course you know one way to kind of to sum it up is that basically we've had 40 Years of inclining debt to gdpa on the public level and 40 Years of falling interest rates and so that was that was an offset um but when indust rates finally hit zero and start going sideways um that Rising debt to GDP and the industry expans associated with it starts to actually matter um and I think we're in that period now um and and so are some other countries like Japan for example but uh the us being the being the largest country that is kind of entering this fiscal dominance mode all right well said um yeah Dan or Lynn that's something Dan has talked about a lot and we've talked about here like flipping the last 40 years on on its head right like it's everything is kind of you know what what you just said there went from and the last 20 you know low interest rates to an actual interest rate um here and but just like what does I mean so do you how do you see this kind of unfold holding ahead you know this this fiscal dominance I mean I know you you've talked other places about the you know the 1940s how there's some similarities here but like once a period like this gets going um you know what's like what you find about like what what where are the next steps in it uh so basically the in general they're unable to raise rates as high as they prefer um because they start running into bank solvency issues that become systemic uh and the effects that they have start to turn backwards which is you can you if it gets bad enough you can get to a situation where rate hikes are inflationary um you know the US is is kind of teetering on that range we're not like firmly in that range but you see that in certain Emerging Markets um where rate hikes actually result in more money creation um because basically the the larger Sovereign deficit for example which is someone else's income um and so they can get into kind of a tail spin where that's that's not the main variable and it starts to actually exacerbate it so I think I mean bringing it back to develop markets um basically I think that we're in a period of higher than Baseline inflation um for kind of the foreseeable future I mean until something more structural changes um and generally speaking when sovereigns get to these debt to GDP levels um those Bonds in real purching power terms are not going to do well basically the The Sovereign defaults one way or another and when you control your own currency it's usually not nominally it's usually through gradual loss of purchasing power um and finding ways to make nominal GDP go up faster than the the sovereign debt or at least as fast as it um and so back in the 40s they did yield curve control kind of like what Japan's doing today where they basically have above Target inflation but they still pin the full yield curve down anyway to varing degrees um right now the US is trying a different approach which is okay we're going to jack up indust rates we're going to try to strengthen the dollar we're going to keep Energy prices low we're going to try to slow down the rest of the world that has all this dollar dominated debt because that can help cril inflation um but they have somewhat limited tools for what they can really do at the end of the day um and so I I think basically when you have an emerging market that has above Target inflation for a long time the hard part is no one no one's got an exact reason of why it's happening it's a it's a bunch of factors happening together and it's just it's kind of this background factor that people have to deal with in that economy it just becomes part of what they have to deal with um and I think that the us is going to be in a Emerging Market light situation which is to say that um some of the things you see happening in Emerging Markets or some of the things you see happening in the developed world back in like the 1940s um that's kind of the background thing that that we're going to have now for a period of time to varying degrees I think the the highs of inflation infation and the lows of inflation are both going to be higher than they were say back in the 2010s they already have been but I think that that's something that I don't think we're going to comfortably go back to just you know 2% inflation uh at least during periods of time where you're not in a recession like you could you could get inflation down in a recession but as soon as you try to um come out of recession I think that inflation's kind of ready to reemerge there until there are more structural changes and and given how polarized or locked in a lot of this structure is I don't really see those structural changes happening for the foreseeable future like an investment Horizon all right so I'm I'm keep going back to one of your initial thoughts when you said you know when does all this blow up because I have to tell you um this concern with with deficits and debts and things I've been hearing about I'm 62 and I've been hearing about it my whole life right my whole life I've been hearing about this from and and when when I was young the analysts who are saying it and the investors who were saying it were old so you know it's it's something that a lot of folks have constantly been thinking about um but the fact that that you made a very sort of conscious decision in 2017 to change your focus um do you have an idea of you know the kind of timetable we're talking about when does this be when does it sort of I want to say blow up but but um when do debts and deficits um very obviously start to matter right now yeah like like become something that people have not are not familiar with you know like the world looks that everybody is it's obvious right you know what I'm talking about it becomes so important that people just they don't talk about anything else for you know however long you know it's like a crisis yeah so it's a it's a good question I think it happens in stages I think the one of the first ways is manifest was back in 2019 with the repo Spike um and be those of us that were monitoring fiscal dominance at the time were like okay it seems like on the service it's a repo problem um but really it's a t- bill over supply problem relative to how many reserves were in the system and how much liquidity is available to buy them and repo was used as a funding source for example to buy t- bills um and so like me and others said well the fed's probably going to have to just outright buy T bills even though it's it's it's on the surface it's a repo problem and sure enough you know in in in mid September the repo rate blew out first they were helping with repo markets but then by mid October the fed's like okay we're going actually going to buy some T bills we're just going to buy and hold more t- bills we're going to stop reducing our balance sheet we're going to start model increasing our balance sheet again and that was basically that the the FED had to respond to the the fiscal side of what was happening um because they cannot abide by illiquid or otherwise dysfunctional treasury markets um in March 2020 when everything shut down of course initially there's a a bid to the treasuries um so yields dropped um but kind of at the at the worst part of it um they got to a phase where the dollar was spiking and you see a lot of foreign entities start to sell assets to get dollars to meet their dollar liabilities and that even includes treasuries so treasuries were um going down in yields up in price until it got bad enough that even treasuries started to have problems and then the FED steps in with you know um like a trillion dollars of liquidity in a matter of weeks to basically reliquify the treasury market and get it functioning again um and uh you know that's and then also basically the the early 2023 banking issue um uh that basically there they had to shift to being somewhat pro- liquidity for a multi-month period despite the fact that they're fighting inflation um ironically because banks are having solvency issues around treasuries um and and the sheer amount of treasuries that they bought and now banks are less a treasury purchaser um so first the fiscal dominance initially shows up in some of these kind of more notable but still fairly benign issues uh of course the the inflation we had over the past few years like we got up to 9% official CPI a lot of that was the the fiscal impulse that happened I think we only get to a phase of kind of structurally being in fiscal dominance and people fully knowing we're in fiscal dominance when a couple things happened one is that the Federal Reserve is no longer able ble to shrink its balance sheet despite above Target inflation uh that that's one Hallmark that basically there's so much treasury Supply coming to Market um that the FED has to kind of accommodate that to varying degrees even though inflation might be two and a half three 4% um they might be still periods of time where they have to be pro- liquidity even though um inflation's above Target that that's kind of one big Hallmark that's kind of what Japan's in now they have above Target inflation but they're still increasing their balance cheap but of course their inflation is still low it's Japan so we kind of they get they get sort of a pass for now um but I think they're going to be stuck in that situation for a while and I think that the US is is going to enter that situation um but without some of the things that Japan has um so our our CPI probably be higher uh and I think the second time it manifests is when you get another energy price spike I mean as long as Energy's kind of range bound like oil prices gas prices as long as that's range bound that really helps keep inflation in check and some of the more obvious things don't manifest the problem is when you're running fiscal dominance um the FED is basically having to accommodate the treasure Supply despite above Target inflation and you're in that period for a period of time and it still seems kind of contained and then the situation runs into some sort of energy shortage um just kind of structurally higher energy prices um then you kind of say the FED can say well we can't really fight that because we're accommodating the the treasury situation um and that's what a lot of merging markets find themselves in um and I think that the US is is kind of gradually entering that um period of time and and to your point around people have been saying that Deb's been an issue for a while it's funny because in some of my uh newsletters like I'm I'm fully aware of that so by the time someone says the Deb's a problem everyone's like you know of course we've heard this before for decades and one thing I pointed out is that if you look at Federal interest expenses a percentage of GDP um back in the late 80s and early 90s that hit a peak um because that basically kind of peak indust rates Rising deficits and so for example the national debt Clock went up in the late 1980s um and and Ross Pro ran the most successful independent presidential campaign largely based on the debt and deficit uh in the early 90s that was kind of the peak Zeitgeist for the debt matters deficits matter this is unsustainable um but then you know China opened up to the world starting in the 80s and really accelerating in the '90s 2000s uh Soviet Union fell uh around that time and opened up that basically a lot of Labor and energy from the East connected to Capital uh in the west and this was a 30-year structural period of of kind of exceptional disinflation globalization productivity and it really offset a lot of the things so a lot of people that feared at the time didn't expect 30 year 30 more years of like falling interest rates zero interest rates uh some some countries even negative interest rates um and the sheer amount of kind of um efficiency we'd have and I think going forward um and what a lot of people learned in that period like a lot of people learned in the 2010s especially after the global financial crisis they they were like okay debts don't really matter this is never going to be an issue and I think that they learned the wrong lesson from that period um and I think that now the like in in recent years the peak Ze I became you know this is never going to really matter in any of our lifetimes and I think that that that was kind of precisely the wrong time and I think I think the pendulum has kind of hit one side it's starting to slowly come back and so I think going forward we're in a period where it gradually starts to matter again it you know the the large monetized fiscal deficits mattered during covid they matter now and I think it's going to be a recurring thing where they actually are a big background thing that that matters yeah and as a guy focused mostly on equities all of this smells like um you know Irving Fisher permanently High Plateau thinking you know well you know the profit margins are just wider because well we you know it's a new world and we have a lot of there are a lot of businesses that just didn't exist before and there are higher margin businesses with get higher returns and uh you know similar arguments I I and and therefore they Garner higher valuations so maybe we're you know that Plateau is permanently higher as well but uh you know we we see how this has turned out in history haven't we it's every time somebody starts to think this way it's it's almost a sign that the end the end is near and the cycle is about to turn isn't it I mean just yeah I think basically yeah the idea that Industries can be zero you can pay any valuation for equities and uh the the deficits don't really matter there's a limited bid for treasuries um that was kind of the this invin like things are invincible basically that was the the Z gist in say the late 2010s it's like look we even got past the global financial crisis you can print your way out of anything um that that and without consequen you can print your way out of things and it won't really manifest but um looking into the Nuance is where that's important so for example a lot of my work in 2020 was trying to show why some of this stimulus was actually going to be inflationary this time because people were like look we saw this in 2008 people said it's going to be inflationary it it was not inflationary and so I'm sitting there in 2020 is saying th this is different than 2008 I mean this isn't just recapitalizing Banks this is money that's getting out into the broad money supply you're sending checks to people yeah yeah yeah and and so I mean this is going to be very different and we saw that play out and since then it's just been a matter of going through the cycle so in 2022 I'm like okay now they're tightening now it's going to be bearish um but then we started to see signs of fiscal dominance reemerging um by kind of early 2023 it's like okay we're actually kind of Through the Looking Glass and now that some of these rate hikes risk actually being stimulatory for those receiving it um and I think I mean one of the Hallmarks of fiscal dominance is is there's bigger than normal Divergence between sectors so we you know economists have like we're looking for a recession in 2022 um we never really got one um but certain sectors are in recession for example manufacturing went through a recession commercial real estate obviously in a recession basically depression um whereas if you're so if you're if you're one of the areas it's impacted by the tight monetary policy you you went into a recession or nearly so whereas if you're one of the entities that is on the receiving side of the deficits um you're not really in a recession some sometimes you're in a boom sometimes you're at least Treading Water you're doing well um and so you get kind of bigger than normal performance gaps between different sectors which which is relevant for Equity selection and things right so who's on the receiving end we know we mentioned energy right yeah energy I mean from the deficits particularly uh who's on the receiving side is people who hold a lot of assets um especially some of that shorter duration um interest bearing security so for example if you hold money markets like if you're if you're a let's say you're a upper middle class um homeowner right you got your locked in mortgage um you've got your money market fund now every time the FED raises interest rates they actually just pay you more in your money market fund uh and if if it translates into more CPI then it translates into higher um cost of living adjustment for Social Security and you receive more from that uh and so really kind of the the the the older wealthier segment is kind of on the receiving side also the the medical spending um you know basically Medicare Social Security and interest people who hold things that get a lot of interest um so it's kind of like the the wealthier um segment or those that are similarly positioned so financially like my my profile looks kind of like you know that demographic as well even though I'm younger I have locked in mortgage I have some money markets and literally just that's more investment income that is technically spendable um and so and then you know a lot of them are spending on um travel they're spending on restaurants they're spending you know some some in that demographic are helping their kids or grandkids afford a house or a wedding right that some of that does circulate back into the economy um and so that's what we're seeing if you're on the right side of the deficits um you're you're in a pretty good position whereas if you're on the wrong side of monetary tightness you know you've got a lot of short duration debt for example on on assets that are no longer in their Prime that's when you're in major trouble um and so I think and I think that State's going to be with us for for quite a while quite a while like years 10 years five years just ballpark I I like toise I like to think in fiveyear increments um generally um but basically I expect I mean this I expect this to go into the 2030s I mean if you look at um the Social Security fund that's expected to run down in 2034 uh that changes a little bit they kind of sometimes they move it back year sometimes they move it forward a year um so they have a big decision point when that happens um basically um Social Security receivers would get a haircut um because they would no longer have that fund to draw from and they'd only be able to pay it out of incoming receipts um but that obviously is a huge political issue so there are certain decision points that that come uh in the 2030s um basically I think at least until then this is a a state that the econom is going to be in to varying degrees all right so what uh you know I'm an investor I I want to do something with my money it sounds like you know a money market or maybe you know rolling t- bills uh is is not a terrible idea um what what else yeah generally in inflationary period shorter duration debt is if you're owning it is better than longer duration debt um uh I've been emphasizing the topic of the three-pillar portfolio which is instead of just stocks and bonds because stocks and bonds are both geared toward structural economic growth and disinflation disinflationary growth that's what they prefer if you look at the the there's four decades uh in kind of modern history where the developed World ran into some degree of significant energy inflation and overall CPI inflation so those were the 2010s the I mean the the 1910s the 1940s the 1970s and then the 2000s um and in all four of those decades um a a 6040 stock Bond portfolio did not do very good in real terms um generally kind of chopped along in nominal terms uh you might have gone up in nominal terms but but you kind of underperformed in real terms and what historically did well uh in those environments were some combination of energy energy producers precious metals hard assets um uh things like that uh and and the problem with a lot of those assets is they they perform poorly for like two decades then they have an amazing decade and then they perform poorly for two decades then they have an amazing decade but it just so happens and it's it's not an accident that the decade that those tend to do well are those inflationary decades um where the 6040 does not do particularly well and so I think one one thing that investors should consider is basically having that slice in a portfolio of things that should do well in that more inflationary or stagflationary type of environments um and those are things that are right now currently under owned uh not very expensive um and so I like to find assets that you know if energy chops along sideways for a while these stocks are still going to do pretty well um but then if you do get structurally Rising prices then they're going to do disproportionately well um and so I think I think looking for things like that to add to a portfolio matter I also think that balance sheet analysis matters more than it did in the prior decade so um if you find entities that have a lot of low duration locked in debt um and then they have variable cash flows you know that can kind of go up with price increases and money supply um they're in a pretty good position as long as the valuation is is reasonable all right are you um you know I know you have subscribers to your newsletter to think about but uh are you comfortable giving us a name or two or no well I mean for example ENT Enterprise Products Partners is a pipeline um and you know they they locked in something like 20 year average duration debt with a for handle on average um and then they're you know they're they got 25 years of consecutive distribution increases they're trading at historically low valuations um and so that that's the type of enity I mean obviously that's a that's a lower volatility higher income type of play um there are other ones I I like a lot of the energy producers in general um particularly ones that can get through the cycles um I've actually been looking at some Latin American equities because um there's really early signs that they might be bottoming compared to some of the US assets um and that they might have gotten through some of the worst of their you know they were they were struggling under a strong dollar environment during the the whole kind of 2015 to 2019 period uh then they got hit by the lockdowns then they then they got hit by the FED raising rates in to fight inflation after the the lockdowns and a lot of them had to I mean a lot of them raised rates to double digits um they got super positive real rates in many cases and now they're kind of initially showing signs of easing um and anything that and the companies that kind of made it through that turmoil um are are kind of um hardened uh and under owned and inexpensive because no one's sitting there waking up today and saying you know what I want to own I want to own Latin American Banks exactly no one's no one's saying that was the one I thought of too and so I think with yeah so so like with careful position sizing I think that's that's an area worth looking into because I am finding things that just you know their fundamentals are now recovered but their price hasn't because um investors have been well trained to just avoid all that put everything into US large cap growth and and sleep well at night um but I think I think some of these uh kind of rotations are happening it doesn't mean it's going to happen next year um but if they stopped making lower lows especially in total return because some of them pay good dividends but if you if you start looking at total returns some of them have not really made a new low versus US equities in like two three years um and so I think they're starting to get interesting all right you got a specific country or no I've been looking at Brazil Columbia Mexico um you know there's Argentina is a more complex case obviously um but yeah ones that are um doing reasonably well um but they're still very inexpensive because un quite understandably just there's no appetite for for foreign investors to really have much exposure um so I have been kind of looking at again just careful with position sizes um but things that made it through the 2014 to 2023 period uh yeah they're pretty hardened and and they're pretty cheap yeah I years and years ago I recommended bladex in my newsletter and um I think it was the price tag was single digits and you know I made the exact same argument it's like you know if these people these are Latin American Bankers if they you know they and they're still around consider what you have to do to just survive you know let alone um you know sort of Thrive uh in that environment and this thing is dirt cheap right now you know that back then I was making that argument so um I'm really uh it's funny your your your um many of your your arguments and your ideas just um kind of are a little heartwarming to me because you know they they represent things in my past and I'm glad to hear someone uh younger than me thinking this way so um let's see now I think we are getting near to yeah we're we're right at the time for our final question um which is the exact same question for every guest no matter what the topic even if it was a non-financial discussion it would still be the exact same final question um if you've already said the answer by feel free to repeat it um and the question is very simply if you could leave our listeners with just one idea today what would you like to leave them with I think one idea to be familiar with is how technology impacts money um and and that's a different topic than we were just discussing this is very kind of value oriented macro oriented but basically um so right now if you look around the world there's 160 different currency monopolies um fiia currencies and they all have you know monopolies over their own jurisdiction and the money that flows in or out of them is pretty tightly controlled because obviously you know physical value through an airport uh is is pretty restricted and Bank transfers are pretty restricted and surveilled um but Technology's gotten to the point now with things like Bitcoin or stable coins where value can just flow across borders in a more peer-to-peer way it kind of goes around those gateways um and so for example if if I hire a graphic designer in Nigeria you know she could hold up a QR code on a video call or she could send me a payment string over a DM or an email and I can pay her in whatever money she wants it could it could be dollar stable coins it could be gold back stable coins it could be Bitcoin it could be whatever she wants it can go around her country's fake exchange rate it can go around her country's local currency um and that really that really only reached macro scale in the past 5 years so even though Bitcoin was around for 15 years and stable coins are now about 10 years old they were small assets until the past you know three to five years um and you know stable coins are now something like a hundred billion dollar market um obviously bitcoin's over a trillion but it's more volatile um and so these these assets are starting to get kind of a macro scale and that has that has macro implications they're big enough that they actually matter on the macro level rather than just the idiosyncratic investment level um and what that essentially means is that Capital can flow around the world faster now in a more in a more decentralized way in a way that especially if you're if you're trying to operate a monetary system in that country and you got structural inflation and capital controls and things like that all the tools that people have to go around that and protect themselves are way stronger now um and so and I think that's that's going to start having macro impacts um I I think that that a lot of these currencies are going to become untenable um and and you know PE like peer-to-peer trading and things like that just goes around a lot of their Capital controls um as long as the society's reasonably well connected um and so you know I I think that's something to look at from an investment perspective either having exposure to those type of things or at least anytime you make an investment be like is this disruptable by the fact that money can now flow across the world across borders um around these things much faster I mean in in Africa there's something like 40 currencies and in Latin America there's something like 30 currencies and every you know imagine if every state in the US had a different currency imagine all the frictions um that would happen and um basically all of those all those crossb flows are frictions and some of these things just go around it um you know St coins can just move around from one entity to another entity in a different country as long as they're not on some like sanctioned list you know and uh as long as that's the case that that really kind of alleviates some of the bottlenecks that some of these companies and people have had in those regions um when they start to really kind of realize that's happening and able to catch on and right now it's not it's not um evenly distributed so for example Nigerians are way more into this stuff than say Egyptians even though they have kind of similar currency problems and you know they're the among the two most populous countries in Africa um uh so it's not it's not like it's happening everywhere equally but there are certain kind of Vanguard regions where this is starting to have a pretty significant impact and I think that that can be a bullish development for a lot of these places um that can now access money they prefer access and moved around more efficiently that that alleviates a bottleneck they've been dealing with for for decades oh that's a cool answer thank you for that that's great and and you know it sounds like there's a lot more to talk about maybe we'll have you back on the show and we'll talk about that but thanks for being here I really enjoyed it opinions expressed on this program are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily

[Applause] hello cactus welcome to the show it's always a pleasure to see you you too Dan it's been too long looking forward to uh revisiting with you yeah so um actually I think the last time we ran into each other might have even been the I feel like it was at some conference or other maybe in Las Vegas at the stanbury conference right right so yeah been been a while um and if you been on the show before it was before my time because I went and looked through the archives so um so you're effectively a new guest to the show um so we should tell our listeners um who haven't heard from me in some time um who you are and what you do and uh and to me like if I if somebody said who's Cactus I'm like he's a real honest to goodness Texas Oil Man period that's like the full description right I mean exactly that that fits me to yep so and you know who better to talk to about about that business that somebody than someone who actually does it right so the first thing I guess I want to talk about is I'm sitting here in front of my computer and I'm looking at 78 bucks or so for WTI Crude um folks can make money at 78 bucks can't they no doubt yes it's uh the they're getting to where they're drilling a lot longer laterals uh they the economics are looking better between the higher oil prices and and uh people look at the rig counts and the rig counts are going down however what they're not seeing is that instead of drilling one mile long laterals like we used to now we're drilling Three Mile laterals and so those three mile laterals that that one rig is drilling the equivalent of three Wells five years ago so it's uh R count a little bit deceptive yeah that's definitely something you don't hear from uh Wall Street people okay these days when they're talking about what's going on with oil yes and the other thing that that's going to be interesting in the future is these horizont Wells are only have like a 5% recovery factor and so 95% of the oil is unrecoverable with today's technology you know 5 10 years from now we'll be able to go back and hopefully Harvest another 5 10 15% from these Wells wow did not know it was that low I knew it wasn't particularly high but I didn't know it was that low um so that's very interesting like Cactus what's your history in like gasier plays any most of what I've been doing has been in the oil plays I've been you know looking at at hanesville marcelus uh I have a good friend that just sold out to Tokyo gas uh in the hfield he's been there for probably five or six years and was back by Quan which is a local firm around here they actually may offices are in Houston but they originated at a little town outside of avalin called Albany and anyway they gave him I think like $800 million and he turned it into 2.7 billion and so he they just closed that deal like a month or two ago uh so I I keep my eye on it but um it's a little far away from me that's far east Texas right along the Louisiana line and of course the marcelis is is up in Pennsylvania but I've been trying to follow that through Porter because he's done such a good job with with the investigating eqt and everything that they've done and so uh those two areas are probably going to be supplying the majority of the United States gas for a long time right and I find gas really interesting now because um it's just been obliterated I it's just uh you know the price pricing has just been obliterated and you know unless you're in um you know like perian with like essentially negative break evens um not a lot of folks are making a huge amount of money with gas right now which is for investors you know that could be an ideal entry point right exactly I mean there's so much more upside natural gas than there is downside they've already got it so low at a buck and a half that's just you're barely able to even break even and so I think that that is probably going to change once we're able to get uh once the marcelis is able to be able put in an LG facility and ship to Europe I think that's going to have a big effect on the prices and then also they're they're currently building a pipeline in the peran through Mexico to the uh West Coast and that will have a big effect the thing that I worry about there is you know the cartels are essentially going to you have to be paid off I don't know exactly how that's all going to work in Mexico you never know but uh I do know that they've got it you know all the money raised for it and they're starting construction on it so uh that's going to be very interesting to see how that plays out that that will get her in gas going to the Orient and we'll give the marcelus gas one to Europe yeah and just for The Listener sake when you say affects the price gas is a little bit more expensive in those places [Laughter] Europe and a half I think down the winter it's in some of those European Winters it gets up 25 $30 you know so you're talking about multiple that's huge yep and obviously you know there's an Arbitrage Factor but you know that that that will take a little time to kick in um exactly yeah so it's uh potentially really an interesting uh development here and not one that's going to happen in five minutes either right it's not something it's not like we're waiting for next month well yeah that's true um the but they it's getting closer and closer all the time I have doubts about that PP planine on the west coast but just as soon as you know if Trump does get elected and allows the pons to be built you know out where we can put it on an lngg facility in the water and start shipping it out I don't think that's going to take a terribly long time but you're going it's not going to be next month or next year it's going to take a couple of years to get it done but I think it's it's you know they've got everything all lined out to get it done and we also make eqt you know a vertically integrated uh mhm gas major gas company and so that's that's going to be very interesting to see how they handle all of that yeah yep uh and I find gas also interesting um for the reason that I find you know things like copper um and even to an extent like uranium um and frankly oil interesting because you can buy an eqt or you know couple other kind of big cap well-run companies and expect um a really awesome return over the ne you know the next I don't know just say few years to several years um with in other words you don't have to take a lot of risk buying a lot of you know garbagey little companies that you don't know what's going on in them um you can buy the sort of Blue Chip natural gas producers and expect to do really well right I mean exactly I think that's a wonderful strategy yeah um and it's it's exciting because let's face it um you know natural gas is not exactly known to be you know it's known to be a pretty volatile commodity right um I mean we're sitting here talking about how the pricing has been just obliterated and and that happens with gas it's obliterated and it sores and it's obliterated and it sores um and and yet yet here we are I mean it's really kind of calmed down and just settled in you know way under two bucks here and uh yet an eqt is still making money I just think it's um as an investor few things are more exciting than this to me because of the just the risk reward proposition um what's the risk reward proposition that you face uh in your business when you go directly at it you know you get the financing you drill the holes um what's that like it you know mine is more of wild catting exploration where I'm trying to find new smaller traps of oil whereas theirs is more of a mining operation they knowly what they've got they their biggest hurdles are pipelines and and the technology to drill long laterals and and Recovery factors and and those type of things so you know our whereas these major oil companies used to be you know more into exploration now it's more I call it mining because it they know what's there they got to decide how they're going to get it out how they're going to get it you know to the end user you know what regulatory problems they have what uh you know and also furthering their technology on it uh I'm not sure about the recovery factors on natural gas I'm sure they're a little higher than the oil recovery factors but I haven't seen any official figures out on that I have to dive into that a little deeper but you know what I try to do in my business is if if I can find a it's much smaller scale you know I try to find a a prospect that would give somebody uh 10 or 15 to one return on their money however I've got the risk of dry holes whereas the majors you know that's more of a mining operation they're going to make them well every time they grow so mindes you know have comes with inherently more risk but it also comes with more reward as well uh you know when you do find those those good fields that can give you 10 to one retiring your money then it's uh it it makes it more like a business that a that a crap sheet at the casino right so you exploration is is an interesting topic um because again in um in those other you know actual mining industry like you know um just pick on copper uh what what you see is you know before about 2005 or six or so the peak of the housing bubble lots of new discoveries made every year then after that date after about 2006 there are I think four years where no new discoveries were made and now just for regular sort of GDP growth globally um Robert Friedland one of the big U entrepreneurs in the space um says we need eight escanda mines eight of the largest copper mine in the world just to keep the economy you know humming along the global economy going and they don't exist so what what's the situation in um in in oil are we you know is there a dur of exploration are there enough guys like you out there wild catting um I missed a little bit there was a gap in your your oh sorry audio but anyway are there enough guys now yeah yes and no uh I'm a Dying Breed I'm a I'm a mom and Shop or Mom and Pop type shop you know I'm very small I've got two or three employees and and but I've got a group group of people when I get ready to drill well I've got my drilling contractors my loggers my my dirt people the people with the doers that build a location you know all these different people that I contract with to drill my Wells uh the one thing that I do see particularly in the Perman Basin which is the most important Basin in the United States it basically uh deliv 50% of our well output and United States so all the others Alaska Oklahoma California you know Louisiana they they all together combine about 50% heran provides 50% of the oil but what I see there is it's such a consolidation really five companies now control about 80% of the ear you know you've got Chevron and Exon and Diving back and oxy and kico and those those five companies control about 80% of it so there's not really room for any little guy anymore or very seldom is there room for little guy I'm where I drill is on they call it the Eastern shelf which is the eastern part of the peran Basin and it's much show you know my Wells that I drill are anywhere from 3,000 to 6,000 ft deep whereas when they're out in the Basin you know they've gone out there and they're basically at four different benches of the wolf camp and those Wells are typically anywhere from 7,000 10,000 ft deep and then they'll drill three mile l so uh now the new play out there is and I think the reason that these these buy up everybody is there's a new play called the Barnett well the Barnett Shad play was the first waron play you know Fort Worth Basin it was in the Fort Worth area and so now all these companies going back back deeper Drilling in the Barnett and having a good bit of success and so they'll be able to control that they also can control the oil prices to a certain extent between OPAC and those companies you know they're not going to go crazy like an independent does you know like when oil prices you know back in 15 16 17 they were $30 $40 a barrel you had companies like pioneer and and or the equivalent thereof and they were they just kept r on drilling but they were drilling all of the best locations first that that could make money at $30 oil now there's not a whole lot of production left out there that you can make money at $30 it needs to be $40 or $50 and so now that they come back and they've secured all this acreage and they've got all their infrastructure in place pipelines refineries the the you know Electrical uh the Water uh all of that is in place then they can go back and drill that Barnett shell and and probably their other zones deeper than that that they can go into and tap into the W reserves there as well right Cactus are we running out of oil no you know it was kind of interesting one time decoil and you kind of scratched your head a little bit yeah I know I know the over fields are going to eventually play out to a certain inad you look at what they're doing in Saudi Arabia garar you know that's the ultimate oil field but uh if you look at what's in the peran Basin I mean you have oil fields that are the wolf camp that cover literal whole entire counties and so from an herial aspect expect it probably is on the same level as garir and but this is at the very early stages of exploration whereas garare was discovered I think in the 40s or 50s I mean at some point uh that field is going to become noncommercial but what I question is you know that's conventional what about the sh going to ask yeah you know they haven't even tapped into the shells they you know that's you we we're not going any be having any peak oil any time in our lifetimes that we're our kids or grandkids most likely I see um yeah that was but as soon as you mentioned gu I was like well you know it's it's still conventional which is amazing um considering how long it's been going so you like oil you're not that much into gas but you admit gas has you know got a lot more upside than downside right now um is that just um is it just too different like technically or like you're an oil wild cater and that's who you are and that's what you do and that's all there is to it like you're you're just not going after the gasier stuff because it's just not what you do is that correct well in the production on the Eastern shelf where I am is primarily oil we have a little bit of associated natural gas but I see gas that I produce is is you know maybe a tenth or a 20th of the income that I get from oil whereas in the peran Basin it's it it's a bigger percentage you know even though they're it's oil fields they have a higher the Go gas oil ratio and so they have to go places with their gas because they can't produce just the oil without the gas with it so as you're bringing that up from the ground you have a conglomeration of of water oil and natural gas and then once it gets on the surface we separate out the water the gas and the oil put the gas in the pipelines the oil oil tanks and the water we we uh inject back into disposal well so and that's that's another thing that's a little shaky out there right now is these we've been putting all this water into these uh different zones uh putting water back and you would think that the pressure would equalize but it's doesn't really work that way and now it's causing some earthquakes and there but there I was in my very first earthquake in Leck Texas about a year ago and I was in like the eighth floor of a of a nice hotel and with my family and all of a sudden our cocktail table starts shaking and I and they were like well what's going on I said that's an earthquake but uh that's first one have experience and and they haven't done any damage but uh the Railroad Commission which governs all that o of gas in Texas uh they're looking into it and and there's got to be some other places to dispose of water or another way in which to dispose water in order to to keep these earthquakes from happening earthquakes in Texas hey we had one here not too long ago either over in in Baltimore or New Jersey at least um but Cactus I it kind of brings me to a question I had for you about regulation legislation um you know it's always kind of in the news I mean what What legislation is kind of uh I don't know either making life hard or influencing things you know too much or or you know significantly in your in your view you know we talking about the natural gas export you know uh decision a couple months ago um just wondering what like when you think of legislation what do you think about well Texas is a very friendly oil and gas environment and so when you're building pipelines or or you know wanting to build an LNG facility out on the water at Gulf Coast it's a lot easier to get things done but when you look at what bid has done like he shut down um the Wilderness Area in Alaska so that exploration has been shut down uh he shut down pipelines that they want to try to take gas you know from Pennsylvania out to the water where they could put it in these LG facilities and and ship it all over the world so you know he shut down a lot of those areas but I I don't think you can shut down Texas but uh the the two biggest gas areas are and the hanesville and hanesville is closer to the Gul Coast a lot easier environment there's probably I'm going to guess close to 10 different uh LNG facilities where they're freezing the natural gas and shipping all over the world but you know mercelis is basically supplying the East Coast by the Northeast with gas for their you know their winterers and and heating and cooping and and so the other regulatory thing that I see that doing is they're they're trying to shut down gas stoves in all the chefs across the Northeast are going nuts because all chefs want to cook with gas it's much easier to control the heat gas- wise than electric wise so I mean my wife loves these cooking shows and they're all up and upheaval over that and they're they're a little bit more on the liberal side being you know really creative chefs but they if they're you're going to take away their gas they're going to be very unhappy yeah that's insane I feel like that's one of the things that they kind of talk about and talk about and talk about and then they'll go do something else well we're not going to take away your gas stoves but we will do whatever else they want to do um but as we were talking a minute ago you were talking you mentioned Pioneer and um the I I just happened to be on oilprice.com and I see this headline in front of me um Exon 60 billion Pioneer deal set to create energy super giant so does do do you you mentioned how for example you know five Majors control 80% of the perian when you see a deal like this does it have anything to do with what you do do you care about it at all uh of course I follow it and but they yeah they're in such the big leagues I mean if I'm going to go out and drill well you know it's going to cost me less than a million dollars the Wells they're drilling are generally 10 to 12 million Wells and so they they require 10 times the capital that I do and I'm I'm 69 years old uh none of my kids want to take over my oil company so I'm I'm kind of slowing down a little bit I'm still drilling some but uh you know I'm uh as much as i' like to follow it I'm too at my age I don't really want to go to Wall Street and raise a bunch money and say hey look I want to F we want to try to buy some properties and you know because really every acre of land on the peran is leased it is all held by production leases so you're not going to go find a prospect over there and go up to a land owner and say hey I want to lease your land uh that's just you know it they all bit tied up to right and you're not bumping up against these guys in the Eastern shelf uh what's interesting is some of the small guys that have been at midlin you know that have kind of sold out and they they recapitalized they're actually coming over here in the Eastern shelf biran Bas we're starting we started about I'm going to say five or six years ago drawing horizontal wells in conventional zones in Sandstone reservoirs and we've had some luck with it but we're still on the learning curve we we've found some really good Wells and we've drilled some really bad Wells and we don't know why the bad ones are bad or the good ones are good we've got ideas about it and we're still working on it but it these things evolve over time and trying different things different Frack jobs different lateral lengths different well you know we were trying all kinds of different things and you know we we made a lot of progress but we're still not where we would like to be uh in those instances what I try to do is I try to get in front of these plays and put together blocks of acreage and DET somebody that's capitalized and and I don't have to worry about the day-to-day operation uh I just take a royalty interest and let them have at and so uh for instance there's a put together back in 2011 12 I put together loocks of acreage in eagleford and we came to there and we drilled the the the eagleford and then now uh there's another Zone that they're going back into I just got some new division orders where they're going back redring an area I drilled up 1015 years ago so uh once again the new technology new payo have have uh enabled us to to keep on producing and doing new things out there I'm curious of those majors of the majors that you that you mentioned and and talked about um and technology which ones might be like the most Forward Thinking as in terms of or or putting the most energy or investment into that you know you take a step back and and look at them I think exxon's one one of the best brother corporations in the world you know I think they're just amazing at what they do how methodical they are at it and they they they look out five 10 15 years of what they want to do the ones that I kind of think might be interesting because they're F finally changing their tune are like shell and BP that were you know going all in for this green stuff and then they can see that they're not making Penny on it and so they're changing their their business plan and to go back after oil and I think well maybe those companies have more upside than a Exxon or a Chevron uh I'd have to look at it a little closer before I I recommended it that's just my initial perspective of it yeah yeah no it's something we've I mean we've talked about here with um you know just the whole green energy push and what influence that is is having on everything else um you know pick whatever you want to talk about um it's just it's interesting that conversation and it does I don't know I guess I'm just curious your thoughts on that too well there's there was so much money thrown at Green energy that and and it's all flopping and so those people are not going to continue putting money into things that aren't making money you know Black Rock was set a big deal you know with their EFG whatever their deal is and you know they're finally having us take a step back and say Hey you know we're all make any money and because they put all those regulations because there are so many different boards state of Texas and said by we're not doing business with you anymore they sold all their black rot St and I think Louisiana's getting ready to do that as well or may have already and so some those companies are they're going to have to change what they're doing or they're going to suffer the consequences yeah it's just another it's another version of go woke and go broke I do like that say yeah I mean it's you know anheiser Bush Disney um now actually you uh Porter argues that maybe Starbucks is one of these right because they started letting homeless people come in and use the bathroom and he said it CH it turned them from a business into a charity and now their results are sucking wind they're doing terribly so um you know it's it's uh at some point reality does kick in reality kicks in and we all want our standard of living so we know it's based on oil and gas and it's not based on a whole lot else you know maybe we'll see more nuclear or something that's that's growing around the world although not in the United States so much but yeah you know what though Cactus I'm grateful to the climate people because they kind of turned oil and gas into a better bet for me I got a glass of wine I would uh cheers you there yeah thank you thank you climate scam nuts oh man yeah so but dayto day like day to day um you and your friends aren't ringing your hands about these people though right you're as you as you go about your business right yeah we we're just go about our business and our business has always been terribly cynical and uh I I don't know what's driving uh Saudi Arabia to I mean they really pulled their prod production back and you know they really want to fight for that $ 80 to $100 price per barrel and so uh I think that's done somewhat artificially and you know what's going to change their mind I don't know I I don't know if they're in Russia I know Biden has tried to put pressure on them to you know so that the oil price will go down and they're not they're just not caving in uh the next thing I see on the horizon that you know when when Israel goes ahead and invades Southern Lebanon or Southern Gaza uh I don't know and they essentially annihilate the rest of the loss what is the rest of the Arab world going to do you know with that going down I've seen some predictions of you know $100 oil or you know hell who knows but uh I don't think Biden have a big effect on on what Israel is going to do over there but uh the Middle East things are in constant turmoil in constant change and then there's no way to predict what's going to happen next right and Brent crude is already 83 today as we speak so 100 isn't that far off well well it's not but yeah well um as it climbs to that price range is Saudi going to go ahead and put more of those bar barrels on the market are they going to uh still defend that particular price point right and uh you know and and OPEC is not just Middle East right it's a there's other other countries that probably I would imagine that you know you have a harder time if you're if you're OPEC you probably have a harder time keeping track of whoever Venezuela or Nigeria or somebody right the other thing that I worry about is we've had 10 million people come across our border and and the majority of them are not our friends and yeah you know terrorist events are going to become more wh spread and are they going to be more at trying to kill as many American people as they can or are they going to try to attack our infrastructure our electrical grid the Texas monthly wrote a big article on the Houston Ship Channel about 15 years ago and I'm going boy that was irresponsible journalism because all they did was say they painted out a plan for a terrorist to take out all of our energy if you have some kind of terrorist event the Houston Ship Channel I mean that that would be catastrophic for us so anyway I I don't know what all they've got going on but you know whatever it is it's not going to be good for any of us well I would imagine that um immigration is a more urgent concern for folks who live in say oh I don't know abalene than for me I live in the Northwest you know we never think about it yeah you're you're basically not affected and so but it they're going to be spreading their tentacles all across the land and I mean who would have thought there would be an immigrant problem in Chicago and New York and Philadelphia and DC and Boston I mean a lot of people you know really look down to our governor because he shipped all these immigrants You Know Places across the United States so they could get a taste of what we're having and we're not even shipping you know three or 4% of what's coming across the border out across the United States but you know we got a lot of Mayor squealing yeah so uh let's getting returning to the topic of oiling assas um you mentioned that you're 69 and your kids don't want to take over the business but you're still doing it you just you can't stop yourself you're 69 man and you you've made a you you're a resounding success shouldn't you be on the beach somewhere well actually I just got back from Florida so that wasn't too bad okay it's in my blood I I enjoy doing it I will continue to do it not at the pace that I used to do it but uh the good thing about what I do is I can do it at my own pace I'm not I don't have to meet a budget every month I don't have to you know fight another barrel of oil to keep my doors open uh I I've got to I Love The the risk reward in the uh you know whenever you find a nice well or oil field you're going oh yeah this is great you know then it's kind of a drillin rush and uh so that's that's part of it that I do like uh I guess the part that I don't like is the Regulatory and now so many land owners are very honorous because Through The Years people in Texas that have been big ranches and and own land everywhere they they'll sell the land but they'll keep the mineralized well the the guy that owns the has bought the surface doesn't want anybody to come on his land well right the Min in Texans the dominant state is the mineral estate so if I have leased minerals under a piece of land that land owner cannot keep me out and so that has created problems and I I understand their problem but they have to understand my problem as well and that you know I've purchased these rights and i' I've got to go to make any money I've got to go drill these Wells and so it it's created a a good bit of tension not very often but occasionally it'll end up the courthouse and uh you know they always lose because it's it's all cut and dried uh as far as the the do of state law of Texas but you know different states are different ways there I think in Colorado at one time they were want to pass legislation where if you were drilling a o you couldn't you had to be like 2,000 ft away from any structure on that land well what's the structure a barn house you know and that didn't pass but it came real close to passing and and I can understand that to a certain extent from some people I mean you you uh when the sho's on the other foot you get a different perspective and so I I don't try to run over anybody I just try to explain to things and these folks and anybody that buys a big tract of land let say they buy a th acre ranch okay they've paid millions of dollars for that ranch they should be Savvy enough to know to consult with an attorney if they don't know about and also real EST estate agents what the the laws are and if they got any mineral rights now they're not only trading mineral rights are trading uh wind turbine rights solar rights so you can retain those if you sell attractive land uh or you can retain a certain percentage of them uh so it's Texas laws being Rewritten as far as wind turbs and solar panels and going as well right so after you know the marcelis just kind of blew up and became a big play I remember all the articles about people um I'm pretty sure it was marcelus because I want to say that I just remember the folks you know in the East they just kind of didn't get it they thought well hey I'm rich I've got I've got oil on my land and now I can finally you know now they're they're learning how to drill it and and I can sell it and I can get rich and they didn't know that that me like an army of trucks and giant equipment on their property just basically ruining it I mean you know we we had a pool put in in our little backyard and they ruined the entire yard right so I remember articles about this and that's kind of what it reminds me of I understand the land owners but you know especially in Texas you'd think they'd get it right it the the good thing about the horizontal worlds is you know they're drilling three miles and in underneath the ground so they the the physical portion of land that they're on is not too obtrusive whereas when I'm drilling vertical Wells I make well I'm putting a pumping unit on it and it's a little bit I'm more of the way than these owners but and usually those big trucks and big equipment and drilling rigs you know they're only there for a month or two and they're gone and so it's it's not too terribly bad but if you're not used to it it can be a problem and people have to understand what's going to be involved like I've got a friend of mine that has a ranch in fact I was there at dinner dinner last night and he has all these Wing turs and he gets paid I think 80 or $100,000 a year for his Winters and so but I find them just God awful I mean I would I would not do that at all however if I had a pumping unit in my yard or if I even if I had some sodar pants somewhere to me it it not is it's not as ugly as as those giant wind turbs however you know everybody's different it doesn't bother him he he he's perfectly happy to put that money in his pocket put up with the wind tur so everybody's you know looks at a little different yeah it's a trade-off it's it's definitely a trade-off you got to make a decision all right um I think we are at about the time when we need to ask our final question which is the same question for every guest no matter what the topic even if it's a non-financial topic exact same question and if you've already stated what you would like your answer to be by all means feel free to repeat it that's fine and the question is real simple if you could leave our listeners with a single thought today what would it be I think ourry is is one of the most important Industries the energy industry whether it's oil gas wind electrical or whatever and it it you use it every day of your life and you need to understand a little bit more about it and I think not only is it a good investment particularly at this time but it's also a hedge against uh if oil prices go to $200 a barrel or if natural gas prices go to $10 if you own some of this stock you have it's a hedge against what going to happen to you as these prices fluctuate and that's uh I'm proud of the business that I'm in I've always done uh as much as I could environmentally to make the Surface appealing and not damage it and so uh I have no problem with it although some people think that if you're buying into oil and gas you're you're buy you're killing the environment and then it's just not the case no taking care of the environment is an energy intensive task great yeah all right Cactus it's always a pleasure to talk with you thanks for taking time out and uh and come to talk with us today mil Rob Dan great to see you Corey take care hope to see you guys soon thank you yeah we'll see you soon opinions expressed on this program are solely those of the contributor and do not

[Music] all right it's time for our interview today and our guest is our old friend and colleague from stanbury Brian Beach Brian welcome to the show hey Dan good to be here thanks for having me back you bet uh we're always gonna have you back you're you're you're I mean you're a value guy so it's just um like if I don't if I want a conversation that's not going to get too crazy on me yeah I know I can count on you if Dan get tired of me mentioning Bitcoin you know you uh oh yeah bit Yeah Bitcoin is not my stick in fact I I sold I sold my Bitcoin ETF right before it tripled um so I I called the bottom perfectly on that yep um so yeah don't don't listen to me on crypto people uh that's that's some good advice yep Listen to Corey yeah don't listen to me either I've missed this whole you know this whole rally I was I was in at the first time I think we bought in April of 2020 or so and I remember that yeah got a decent run out of it but um we missed the we missed the second run up here but that's not what we're talking about today um let's start with something that I realized was a value play originally um which is GameStop and it's back in the news it's it ran up again you know double or triple or whatever in a couple of days last week and uh of course it's in the news again because and it ran up because the um original analyst a guy named Keith Gil who calls himself roaring Kitty on on X formerly Twitter he reappeared Sunday night by posting an odd little um picture of a guy sitting upright in a chair with a video game controller in his hand and Then followed it up with a bunch of other things that kind of said I'm back and you know with a Vengeance sort of but you know this was originally like his his handle on YouTube is deep effing value right this was a value play he genuinely liked the stock do you remember that I mean that's what it was about yeah it's crazy yeah and I and and and it was it was a deep it was a deep value play he thought that the market was uh was missing some value there and and um uh gained a big following and it became uh it took it took on a whole another thing you know Dan really this is this was part of a a big kind of uh smart money versus dumb money um you know uh battle that that played out in in 2021 that I thought was really interesting to watch um I didn't really participate in it but um you know they made a movie out of it I know Corey you just wrote about I can't remember the name of the movie but really enjoyed it dumb money yeah well you just said yeah and Ben mezri who wrote the book was at our uh conference in in Vegas last year yeah such an interesting story and you know Dan you know you you talk about me as a value guy um and I am but I was oddly pulling for the um for the dumb money so-call dumb money as I watched this play out um for a couple of reasons I guess I mean I I cheer for the 15 seeds and March Madness for the same reason you know um but you know going back to 2021 and I don't know how much background you know we need to give your your your viewers or listeners but um you know GameStop just kept going up as people kept piling in and and the smart money the hedge funds um mainly um kept going short kept betting against it because the fundamentals did not support the valuation right so you would think a guy like me who's a value guy would be on the the side of the people shorting it um but there was something much bigger in play here um it was this was about market dynamics um and I don't think the dumb money uh was nearly as dumb as people said I think they understood how the market worked I think they better than they got credit for some of them certainly I think Keith Gil did um and I don't think the smart money was as smart as it as it was that's a that's really a self- nickname by the way I don't you know the um the hedge funds and the banks try to you know institutional investors kind of think of themselves as the smart money um I kind of find myself I don't know how you feel Dan my myself kind of in the middle right I don't have uh hundreds of millions of dollars at my disposal um like the the hedge funds do um uh but I do a lot of fundamental research I think most of my file most of my subscribers um are smart people they can afford a couple thousand dollars um for financial research so they're you know they' they've made um a nice Nest Egg for themselves probably I usually think of them as like retired dentists and and whatnot you know they're not they're just trying to learn more about businesses learn more about how the market works I kind of I'm kind of in the middle of the smart money dumb money kind of thing but what was so funny about GameStop is um uh watching the underdog find this one little corner of the market this one these one or two stocks where they could um really punish the big guys um and and that's been fascinating to watch and of course it went away Keith Gil had to testify and you know went to Washington and all that you guys know the story and yeah but he's back at least at least for a week he was back and it was it was interesting to watch it was I I have been very critical of people who um bought GameStop and AMC But like after they sword to ridiculous you know multi multi tens of billion dollar valuations that's that's what I was critical of I you know before that I I think the guy's like you know it's genius right you you find something you think is deeply undervalued that's also heavily shorted and then go and Reddit and tell the world about it it it just makes all the sense in the world it was it was quite brilliant I don't I I don't think Keith Gil is an idiot at all um no no I think the folks who bought after that the folks who hung on to it they bought the what at at those valuations at tens of billions of dollars of Market valuation it's like the worst garbage in the market and they're holding on to it like it's Berkshire halfway saying you know Apes not leaving right the folks who were buying AMC called themselves apes and they said we're not leaving we're never selling the stock and I thought that was crazy and I still think it's crazy you know that hashtag Apes not leaving it's they're back on Twitter so is that right yeah uh but um but I agree with you it was a fascinating phenomenon definitely pulling for the little guy you know I I I I love that aspect of I love the David and Goliath you know it's like you know it's like as an analogy I just this this might be dumb you guys can edit this out but you think of your high school right or any High School there's like the Geeks and the the jocks right and it's like there's a thousand places for the jocks to beat up the Geeks right and you know thousands of lockers to be stuffed in or whatever under the stairwell but it's like the Geeks got together and they're like the oak tree behind the gym let's all go there right let's just all go to this one spot right and then where they find some jocks there and they just start pummeling them right and then the jocks get scared the jocks start calling their buddies over to the oak look at what's happening with that and the geek there's so many Geeks there they're well-coordinated and they're just pummeling these guys no matter who's coming over but they're smart right they know there's a thousand places where we're going to get beat up yeah but we we found we found this one spot and we're going to um we're g to exact revenge or whatever you know I mean and and and I thought the the screenplay in the movie got into that pretty that Dynamic pretty well um these people understood how the market is supposed to work a lot better than I think um the the super smart short sellers um gave them credit and at the risk of extending this uh analogy too far in the end the jocks kind of went running to the principal with tears streaming that ah you know this isn't fair right and and taking away the buy button yeah right they took away the buy button and Robin Hood so that that the stock couldn't go up and you know the jocks got to dust themselves off and walk away from the tree uh relatively not unscathed but um not at all they were scathed they were seriously scathed some some of the some of the big guys were but you know I think some of them made out okay I mean nobody I don't think they made money but and now we're back right I mean these guys are are like hey I'm I'm still I'm still thinking of that oak tree back there guys you know like what what do you want to do you know and uh you I I like I say I kind of think of myself in the middle I I I'm not smart or dumb money first of all I don't think this like I said I don't think the smart money is that smart the dumb money's that dumb I mean I showed up at the tree just kind of crossed my arms and kind of you know grabbed the popcorn and and and watched it played out I mean it was it was fascinating market dynamics Dan you and I are Big Ben Graham guys we read you know we read intelligent investor every couple of year you know Ben Graham could never have imagined something like this playing out you you know and and um uh and and so we got a real life lesson in in in in markets uh in real time it was interesting to watch yeah yeah F and French couldn't have imagined it either you know yeah I mean yeah you know you can't we're living in weird times you can't say an that the jocks and the Nerds analog analogy in the in the tree I I that's some one I I personally have not thought of that and so that's that's a really good good anal I'm wondering what this quote return of uh Keith Gil actually means if if anything like now like what what is and is it you know I don't know I think a lot of the the people that that were following him got um you know most of them lost a lot of money and they and they I think they've seen I don't know Cory I I think that again they returned to the analogy these jocks are going to get rescued somehow right and and you know I think they they they're a little bit concerned about that and um uh you know I think as we're as we're recording this most of the gains have come all the way back down I haven't turned on my Bloomberg this morning but um I don't I I think that the you know what played out last week has already kind of died down it took days not months or quarters um for this thing to to to play out um uh but I'm going to I'm going to keep my eye on the oak tree behind the gym um anyway it's it's it's interesting and educational both yeah interesting episode I'm um I think it's funny that uh it's funny to me that you know the guy who calls himself roaring Kitty probably just caused a huge dead cat pounce in these stalks I just I I I see what you did there yeah that tick that tickles me to death you know he shows up and he says and he's got all these you know sort of memik video clips and you know about how he's back with a vengeance or whatever and and U you know he's roaring Kitty and you know like we all know that these companies they're not in great shape maybe when Gamestop was a buck it was like deeply undervalued but you know not now and and same with AMC and AMC has done a much better job of like exploiting the the rallies you know and they've yeah I mean their share count yeah it's like 10 or 11x or something I mean it's huge the difference and and they've continued to do it they made another announcement last Tuesday they I think they announced I think I I think they announced Tuesday that they had already um issued like another 250 million of stock and then they announced Wednesday that they issued another I want to say 160 million to swap for debt I was like yeah that's that's you know the what's happening there of course is that the executives are using the mem stock phenomenon to prolong their tenure right I mean essentially it's the same thing they did in 2021 right yep exactly it's what I would do if I were on the board right you know if the Ducks are quacking feed them um you know and uh I can't remember I it is on Twitter I think Matt LaVine wrote about this the other day um he wrote about a couple of things It's Like These Guys these if you've got a struggling company you need to hire roaring Kitty to tweet about it you know so that he can raise the price so that you can sell new shares and raise hundreds of millions of dollars like AMC is doing but you know one smart money play um and I've heard about I don't know who's who's doing it um you know if a stock runs up to eight bucks and one of these meme stocks M you short it this is if you've got a lot of money if you're smart money if you're buy you short it at eight bucks call the board of directors and say I hear you're trying to raise money I'll pay you know seven bucks right so you you you locked in a dollar right there you just however many shares you shorted you offer to to to to buy new shares from the board of directors for a dollar less right um again smart money is pretty smart I don't know if anyone's doing that but that that that would work um as as some of these some of these things you know charge charge higher and Dan you know I talked about this I think the last two times I've been here um I talked about spax uh which was a huge bubble in 2021 yep I've talked about software as a service which is another big bubble uh in 2021 and kind of like roaring Kitty um not not really but similar in in one way it these stories are still playing out right they're not they're not over um what is is um what is once overloved you know is often o ends up overhated um and and as a value guy I end up I'm still looking and finding spaxs in the scrap peap there uh you know that that and there's still an incredible stench around spaxs anything that came public that way um special purpose acquisition companies if if you're you're not familiar and um and software as a service was was super hyped by probably some of these same people who were were were um uh getting excited about um nfts and roaring kitties and whatever in 2021 and uh those valuations are down um I think too much uh and so um I think I was on this show a year ago or something and and um talking about software as a certain it's still down um yeah you know and so the these these stories whether it's the crazy story about you know GameStop or entire SE like spaxx and and um and and software serice you know these things are still playing out um I I haven't seen nftp Story come up Corey you watch the news more than I do but so maybe that one's actually dead but a lot of these a lot of these interesting things from 2021 are still playing out uh for sure yeah nft is actually trying to make a little comeback here so along with the meme stock so that's you wonder what what this means about just Market sentiment at this point in general um you know but yeah it's yeah I mean I wouldn't be personally I'm not touching nfts with uh my keyboard or fingers or what however you can touch them yeah yeah but other than that I think a lot of these crazy stories from 2021 are are still kind of uh still kind of playing out um yeah and uh yeah when you talk about spaxs do you mean spaxs or DPS like postacquisition you know spacks that have merged and and been you know crushed yeah I talk about DPS I mean um what happen what happened in 2021 is is hilarious right so uh uh we'll talk about smart money this is smart money being being smart uh in fact I was just cleaning out my desk I found something I printed in 2020 just this morning so um just to back up a little bit I know you know this Dan and Corey you've been writing about a spa is a a a shell company goes public with nothing but cash right they've got sponsors and they go public with nothing but cash and then they go find a um a business to buy and merge with and you can take that private company um public just by buying the the business so um far Dan FIS podcast Inc or whatever Corey um nft world or whatever right so they you've got this this shell company with cash and you go out and merge with a a business um interesting thing about spaxs is the people who raise the money are able to redeem that that money when anytime kind of before the acquisition happens um and then they get some free warrants on top of that they just need to recruit some people to buy in with them um and and that's where the retail investors or the smalltime guys uh I'm not going to use the word dumb money but that's where the the retail or small time so they needed to go out and drum up interest for this and one of the ways that they did that was by convincing people that the spack is a backdoor way to screw the big guy right to screw the smart this the smart money um and so um that's some background this is something I came across that uh Matt LaVine wrote um I guess it was around 2021 um I cannot get over how good the recent Trend to cut Banks out of IPOs has been for the banks it is one of the great scams of modern Finance people got mad that investment Banks get big fees for taking companies public so they said what if we found a new way to go public one that reduced the power of the banks and the banks put on trench coats and took out mustaches and went to companies and whispered you should do a direct listing or go public by a spa that'll show those evil Banks you know and then that's right the context of this right so it's it's the same thing the banks are still making money and the fedge funds who raise the money they're still getting rich the context of this was he he wrote this in the middle of like a a run where every single Bank was having record earnings right and they're like and meanwhile these banks are have mustaches on and trench coats and are like trying to convince people that uh that they're screwing the banks that was a story that sold in 2021 right and what happened is the Smart money they would redeem all the the money out out after it and the retail investors just got the small guy just got clabbert clobber once the dpack happened and and they would overpay Dan as a valuation guy there was no there was so many spacks and so few decent private companies so they were overpaying for these companies um and then when the SP dpack that's when the merger happen when when the actual you know eventually reality sets in and these things go from $10 down to um four or five or or two or three do or even lower as a value guy um I've you listen people smarter than me figured out a way you know to try to you know pick which spcs were going to go up that that was a strategy that was as a value guy that was not my strategy but if if that's you know if that's what you're doing more power to you um um and uh you're a smarter guy than me I like I waited till they all fell and was trying to pick through the wreckage um that's a whole section of my micro cap portfolio is Spa Splats of course you've got to give it a a cute name spack scrap heaper Spa Splats anything that came public via Spa including stuff that happened you know that there's still spacks happening today in 2024 um and the market just hates it uh the the is there and they're they're selling these things off and there's some decent companies um in the wreckage and again I kind of watch that from the the sidelines I I recommended the first spec uh I recommended was back in 2017 way before this was a hot a hot a Hot Topic um and so I kind of watch from the sideline the bubble and and have been able to try to pick a apart um uh you know some some just it's a hated sector and trying to trying to pick up some some decent companies out of the wreckage um just to go back to the the the lame analogy that spaxx is a place where the jocks absolutely pummeled uh the Geeks I mean they just and and they convinced the Geeks that they were winning that's right um you know it was it's look it's obvious right it's obvious what happens here a couple of smart guys go hey you know something it only cost a couple of million bucks to do one of these spacks let's do that and let's raise a few hundred million bucks and let's just buy any damn thing and take it public and then we'll own 20% of something that's worth hundreds of millions maybe billions even and we'll sell our back shares and that'll be that and then you know by the time we're out the thing's down 80 to 90% but we've made you know way more multibagger above what we spent to create this back right $2 million you know to to to set up a public shell there you go and and you know maybe maybe less than that um and and that's why they were overpaying Dan I mean you don't mind owning 20% of an overvalued company it's better than owning zero you know your money yeah and and if the you know so uh the little guy got hosed I think mainly in that sector and and and so now Dan in 2024 um those of us who are looking at small caps I know that's not really your neck of the woods but um there's still some interesting stuff there that's the best uh performing part of my portfolio for sure yeah I I have done a similar thing I did it unsuccessfully uh I thought the Cannabis bubble had been absolutely destroyed beyond a shadow of all doubt I think it was down 60 or 70% of course then you know went down 80 or 90 or whatever and um tried to buy M sauce you know the big ETF and uh we we got stopped out of it because we were you know if you you buy something down 80% and it falls 90% % whoa you've been you've been crushed right so yeah so um yeah I I've got a couple of cannabis stocks too again it's it's an advantage when I'm I'm able to buy little little companies that you you probably can't with with with your um file with your letter exactly um but uh I do think cannabis is is coming back we I'm up on I think both of them uh one of them's up pretty big and and it's a a company that um makes it safe to do banking uh for uh for cannabis companies to to bank um you know there there's all kind of regulations around that so when um uh you know res when when Nar when cannabis got rescheduled is kind of or is probably going to be rescheduled as as a less uh dangerous narcotic for uh Federal purposes these I think these a lot of these cannabis companies are going to uh come back so I don't think you missed it you maybe were just a little bit early um but you stopped you stopped out huh you're using stop losses uh in your in your portfolio uh all the time now or I know you were you've gone back and forth on that a bit yeah I mean we sometimes we do sometimes we don't um you know sometimes we just uh start out without one and then we don't you know if we don't like the way things are going but we are not ready to call it we'll put in a hard stop at some level and say okay well if the market says it's worth less than this you know then we're going to call it a mistake yeah it's but it's not we're not religious about it in in the extreme value letter we used to I used to never use them at all but I remember that yeah the truth of our business is is not pleasant and that is if people you could be the greatest stock picker in the world and if people subscribe to your newsletter and they get their first issue and they look on the back page of your portfolio if they see minus 30% 40% whatever they think you're stupid even though it doesn't mean anything remotely close to that you know um yeah I think you're stupid for other reasons yeah I know that's right I I'm not saying I'm not stupid I'm just I'm kidding I know that's right he kids because he loves folks but I I you you're gonna edit that out it doesn't matter yeah that's fine um we um we we've just become more selective about it because you know and and we're wrong sometimes too let's face it I mean PayPal was a disaster and we we had to get out of it so um we we're we're wrong sometimes we have to admit that the thing I like about go ahead uh I was just going to say the thing I like about um stops is it takes emotion out of it right um you know as as value guys D you know we I can't remember who said it I maybe Buffett but I think it was Peter Lynch you know if you like a stock at 20 You're Gonna Love It at 10 right like it's kind of baked into you know our DNA that you know if it goes down that's a good thing you should put more of your money and you know um but that's that's a hard way to to run a business or or run a or pick stocks and you know it's a good way to stops are a good way to take a motion out of it you know and and just um uh let the market tell you if you're wrong I will say this some of the tiny companies we do only have a you know some down to like a 100,000 in in in daily trading volume really small so we can't tell two ,000 people to put in a stop loss at the same you know if if 2,000 people stop out of some of these stocks at the same time it's going to destroy the market but what we started to do um is to set up uh and I got we call them guide posts um so if I like a company that because it's growing and it's got a strong balance sheet and it's cash flow positive you know whatever I like about the company I'll set up quantitative guide posts um so that you know it helps me take a motion out of it just like a stock price right I mean take so look I'm looking for 20% growth per year if the first year it's 12% and the second year it's trending towards 8% I got something wrong I need to sell um regardless of what the stock pric is doing uh I I liked this company because it had a strong balance sheet if they take on a bunch of debt to buy a company I'm got of it you know the things have changed um they start losing money uh this happened to me recently with with Dole um which is of course a household name but it was down there in kind of small cap World um and they had one segment that wasn't really doing all that well but they were going to sell that segment to chaita um another household name and I like I like the idea because I I thought that their other segments were making more money they sold that one segment to chaita they could use a couple hundred million dollars pay off the debt I love the way it was going to play out I still like Dole but The Regulators I think was the de J in this case blocked the merger right and so I went ahead and sold I'm like the the my thesis is no longer in play so it's kind of like a stoploss yeah in that you're you're trying to take em motion out of it it's a quantitative thing like they did this merger didn't happen or the cash flows aren't are drying up or whatever um but left to my own devices I'll just be stubborn you know and and and stay in some of these way too long um so that's one of the thing I I have to play it a little bit differently in the micro Cap World but that that's how I've been handling it interesting that you've come around and started using them I I know for years you you didn't yeah yeah I mean they of course there was a famous bit of research that people talk about where they applied religious trailing stops to the extreme value portfolio retroactively and they said well the performance is better than what Dan got and what they didn't tell you was that like if you had never sold anything it would be pretty damn good too so oh really yeah I mean so I remember that study yeah I mean I'd have a I'd have a ton of 10 Baggers multi-baggers if I hadn't if I just had left it all alone you know so have you ever looked at um Amazon since 98 um you know Amazon is up you know whatever it's up I don't even know 30X 100x yeah thousand couple thousand than actually couple thousand way more than that any any year want to pick it's up 30 100 1,000 yeah but it has it it's had 10 or 12 80% draw Downs over that time and and don't U quote me on that right I mean I'm making this up but I mean it especially when it was a smaller company it was con you would constantly have been stopping out uh uh on Amazon um and it was it's a huge huge huge multibagger from the do Peak Peak right even though it lost 90% of its value in the bare market so yeah and I thought I thought the again don't quote me either but I thought it was like at least 10 35% or greater draw downs and you know 25 35% those are like typical trailing stop kind of levels and uh yeah so I wrote about I wrote about this a couple years ago and and I think it was more than that I think it they fell more than that and I think it was more than 10 okay I I was looking over the the the course of its whole trading history not just you know since the the bubble whatever but yeah um I looked at um Costco in that respect and I was like Wow minus 70% minus you know 50% like whoa and of course it's done great too but yeah yeah you got to know that it's it's that's the way to hold on to those is can only be to focus on the fundamentals of the business right you you you can only do it that way because if you try to gauge it by the stock price you'll say well the market knows something I don't and I'm down 80% so I must be wrong rather than I'm not sure a value guy ever would have bought Amazon I mean I I you know they they were always you know Bezos was always kind of investing so much that there was never really cash flow right um if I'm if I'm being perfectly honest I don't know that I ever would have bought in um maybe I would have after a big draw down or something but uh in any case I didn't and um uh you know no the value guys did not want my portfolio that's right they they focused too much on you know current profitability and stuff and um the one thing that you could have done was read that first shareholder letter and it's he talks very much like all the it's like you know all the things Warren Buffett wants a CEO to say you know and and if you read it he's like we're you know we're going to maximize cash flow and we're not going to worry about you you know Gap earnings and all that kind of stuff uh I don't know if that's exactly what it says but that was the gist of it and I thought wow it I had it right there in front of me in the first letter and I whiffed it I did you know I didn't take him at his word so I have to look that up I haven't I haven't ever uh seen that or read that I think it's from 1997 if I'm not mistaken yeah yeah so there were signs but I agree like I you know I I looked at it a bunch of times and I thought I don't get it you know because I was just doing the normal stuff that a value guy does um but and I would and I did something yesterday I was just Dorking around in Bloomberg um and I was looking at I was looking for um companies that reduce their share count a lot over time because I'm doing this little bit on Henry Singleton for my other newsletter um that'll be out in several days here and uh I was looking at um all these companies that made huge returns I I just typed in like you know billion doll market cap or more um total return of greater than 100 or greater than 500% or something in 10 years and so I had all these you know 10 Baggers multi-baggers and stuff and like the first seven or eight of them um their share counts like soared over the period you know they weren't buying back shares they were issuing shares they were in growth mode right which actually if you study Singleton you know tadine was in growth mode issuing lots of shares um in the first decade or so of its existence too so there's that period you know um so I was like yeah those are the those are the ones I should be looking for right the ones that are issuing shares and growing like weeds and have good businesses maybe things can I throw out a name I don't I don't know if I'm allowed to do this um we love names I've mentioned this I've mentioned this company so and I did a presentation on this guy uh so par Technologies is a software company and as I've already kind of said I've I really like par uh I bought I think in 2018 or 2019 it was um it has this weird military Consulting business that no one really knows what it does because it's uh uh contract has contracts with the military um but they also um sell restaurants software and Hardware I you know I'm not exactly there's a there's an origin story about how it ended up in those disparate businesses um but when we bought it the software company was kind of hidden and that's that you know that's one of my favorite stories is a hidden asset and um a guy named savnet Singh bought um bought in uh and and ultimately became CEO he's an investor and I mean Dan if you read what this guy says there's a podcast out there I can give you the link y'all can link it if you want but uh it's from several years ago but he says everything you would want to say and he and his buddies were sitting around um you know in 2017 2016 I don't know when and they were like if Warren Buffett were our age you know and at this point they're probably in their early 30s what would he be excited about what business would be excited he'd be excited about you know when Warren Buffett was 30 he was excited about newspapers right and you know I mean there were there were things that he Insurance yeah what would he be doing today and they were convinced that he would be in software um and especially subscription based software and um the economics there I've talked about it I think last time last time I was here or something but uh we can drill into that if you want but at the risk of rambling um he says all the things you want I mean he's a buff and Acolyte and and now that he's running par yeah he keeps buying up um uh other businesses around restaurant software right um so that you know that the that's the software that schedules the the the the that schedules the weight staff that schedules the kitchen the software that especially processes your payment um the software that you know um the software that takes the order um uh that comes in from uh uh you know um one of the external order you know um and oh par do they do they create did they create partender I know I know that software uh I don't I haven't heard that one it's called partech Uh in the in the industry I know You' got some restaurant background yourself but um uh these guys Brink software was kind of their their first software company um but he says all the things you're talking about and after every earnings call the stock Falls because the cash flow the profitability that people were finally hoping for isn't there because he's investing he's reinvesting uh looking for returns and um I I can't wait you know I I'm up but not a lot I think I'm up 60% over years I'm probably trailing the market um and of course during 2021 I was up 4X and and and didn't sell um so I don't have a stop loss on par um but it's what you're talking about and I could be wrong uh have me back on the show in 2028 and we'll see if this is if this played out the way I think it might um uh but he he's he's saying a lot of the things that you're talking about and and they're they're issuing share when in 2021 when the stock went straight up the Ducks were quacking he fed them he he sold a bunch of shares um sh Shares are share count is going up um it's everything you just talked about um and uh this guy sa meet sing is um a really smart guy he's my favorite CEO in in the portfolio that I that I'm running so and my in in my Publications mon portfol for sure and the the ticker is p par so folks can look up yeah yeah easy to fine yeah and I just want to say that's one of my favorite things about reading Venture value is you know these stories that and and interesting companies that you uh come up with just the it's it's um I mean it's always interesting you know like the just the the origin stories of of the businesses themselves um yeah are car has a crazy crazy story I mean I think the guy years ago he had a contract I I'm I'm missing it up probably but years ago it was a family company and a guy had a contract with the military you know back in Vietnam era um and then as the war was cooling off um his buddy who owned a McDonald's you know needed a cash register um and so he kind of pivoted into that as a side hustle and they ended up with every cash register in McDonald's came from this you know and it was a it was that that's the hardware side of the business right that's not the exciting part of the business the margins were very low and I don't know they were but now they've got all this Hardware out there at all these fast food restaurants and those are potential software customers right so um they're not making a ton of money I don't think on the hardware side of the business but uh they've got this big installed base of of customers who know them and they can try and sell them um on the software side uh crazy story that the family sold out mainly to I think you know sne sings group and some others um but that that family was on the tail end they were selling out basically when when I first recommended crazy story all these little companies have crazy stories right um for sure nothing if the stock picks are bad you'll get some good stories out of venture value for sure okay fair enough all right Brian it's time for our final question um final question is the same for every guest every show no matter what the topic even if it's a non-financial topic it is the identical question every single time and if you have already said the answer by all means feel free to repeat it and the question is simply if you could leave our listeners with a single thought today what would it be what would you like it to be well I mean this is a financial podcast there's a lot going on in the world today that scares me and you know um uh you know that's got my attention um you know we're we're here at graduation season I don't know when you guys are watching this maybe you watch it months later but all these protests and all the the stuff around the world happening it it it uh um that's where a lot of my thoughts and prayers are all always um uh and the in the markets uh just you know there are ways to try and you know it seems kind of Gro grotesque but I mean there we have um a few picks in our portfolio that are that are going to do well uh if energy crisis happens and you know given where there's some Global conflicts right now in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East we think that could uh be an interesting place to look I know you're talking to Cactus in the last episode about that kind of thing um I think that there's some interesting stuff there um also um you know sticking with the financial theme of this podcast uh Warren Buffett um recently repeated I know Corey you were reminding me of this um he thinks he could double his money um in uh small caps I I I don't know if I read it right but he said that before yeah um and the opportunity there I've been saying this for years and it and saying this for at least two years um uh small caps just haven't participated in the rally the way the rest of the market has um as the The Magnificent Seven has taken off and everything um and at some point I think that that's going to correct itself I think that the gap is going to close uh and you're going to want some amount of small caps in your portfolio um I don't think I could uh go 50% a year like Buffett thinks he can um but even if I do half as well as Buffett um that's that's still pretty good uh 25% a year in small caps as that valuation gap between small caps and the rest of the market closes um that would be interesting so um your listeners can check out my letter or if you're not uh interested in that uh figure out a way to get some exposure to to small and micro caps because I I do think Buffett's uh right uh that they're there are some uh uh some opportunities um in that corner of the market it's not it's not really popular at all um right now all right we need to get roaring Kitty to just recommend the Russell 2000 or something um yeah or par I should I should get him on on on on par yeah sounds like we should get the CEO of par on this show that's what we should do oh yeah ah that would be a really cool guest I'll send you a link uh I I've never um talked to him directly but I I know some people maybe we can make that work it' be fun yep all right Brian listen it's always a pleasure to speak
